Jacobi iteration with a 2D Array.

This code uses a 2-D blocked decomposition of a 2-d array with more
than one element per chare. The code runs for a specified number of
iterations, using a reduction to start each successive iteration.

A 5-point stencil pattern is used to update the value for each data
element. For example, the new value for element X is the current
value of X plus the current values of its left, right, top, and
bottom neighbors.

     T
   L X R
     B

X'  = (X + L + R + T + B) / 5.0


To run the program with liveviz, run the parallel job as shown in
runserver.sh, or just do a "./runserver.sh"

While the program is running, connect a visualization client to that
server. To do this you can run "charm/java/bin/liveViz localhost 1234"
Note that port 1234 is the port specified in runserver.sh. You should
at this point see a window appear, with a black background, and
a red/white grid in the upper left corner. Resize as needed. The parallel
server job should also print out a series of lines whenever each worker
is requested to provide a portion of the frame. Resizing the client
window will cause the image to be requested again, but with a different
size. The client can only connect while the server is running. So you may 
have to be quick to get to see anything. You may want to make the client 
perform more iterations so that you have more time to see things.
