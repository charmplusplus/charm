To be able to shrink and expand an application
    1 - Needs to run with a load balancer
    2 - Ccs server option needs to be added during runtime

Example running command:
./charmrun_elastic +p4 jacobi2d 200 20 +balancer GreedyLB +LBDebug 3 ++nodelist ./mynodelistfile ++server ++server-port 1234

Ignore the ++nodelist ./mynodelistfile argument when running locally.

Use the MPI machinefile format for mynodelist. For example,

<ip-addr-1> slots=<nslots-1>
<ip-addr-2> slots=<nslots-2>
<ip-addr-3> slots=<nslots-3>

Use the client to send the shrink or expand command to the running application:
./client <hostname> <port> <oldpes> <number_of_pes_to_be_killed> <list_pes_to_be_killed> <number_of_pes_to_be_added>

For example this command will expand the application from 4 to 8 PEs:
./client <ip> 1234 4 0 4

To shrink the application from 4 to 2 PEs by killing PEs 2, 3:
./client <ip> 1234 4 2 2 3 0

NOTE 1: Charm needs to built with --enable-shrinkexpand option.
