This is a simple 2D structural dynamics program
parallelized using the Charm++ FEM Framework.


INPUT

Several very important values like the material 
properties, boundary conditions, and timestep 
are hardcoded, which is very silly.

The input mesh for this program is read from 
files named "xxx.1.ele" and "xxx.1.node".
The mesh format is compatible with Shewchuk's
"triangle" 2D meshing program, part of the 
Archimedes toolkit:
	http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html

For example, to generate a new mesh, use:
	triangle -pqVAa xxx.poly


PROCESSING

Time loop:
  Compute internal force vector for linear-strain triangles
     in cst_nl.C
  Communicate to sum internal force vector with other partitions.
  Advance nodes based on net force and velocity.
  Occasionally migrate or output results.


OUTPUT

This program exports its solution data via NetFEM.
You can run the program so NetFEM will connect to it
like:
	./charmrun ./pgm ++server ++server-port 1234 ++n 4
You'd then connect the NetFEM client to yourhostname:1234.


CREDITS

The physics code in simple2D is derived from f90 codes
by Philippe Geubelle and Michael Scot Breitenfeld.

The translation to C and rather silly "simplification"
were performed by Orion Sky Lawlor, olawlor@acm.org,
at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
Parallel Programming Lab.  Any errors introduced are mine.
