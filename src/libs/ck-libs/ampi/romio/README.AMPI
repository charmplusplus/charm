Modifications
=============

Here is a list of modifications and clarifications to the version of
ROMIO integrated into AMPI:

* Commented out the unconditional assignment of MPI_IMPL in the configure
  script so that AMPI can specify it when configuring.
* ampi_mpi has been added to known_mpi_impls in configure.ac.
* Configure tests that build MPI executables have been changed to only
  compile object files, breaking a circular dependency between ROMIO and the
  rest of AMPI. See confdb/aclocal_romio.m4.
* The "Your make does not allow comments in target code" and "File locks may
  not work with NFS" warnings generated during the configure step have been
  disabled as being spurious.
* Used MPI_Info_* calls from AMPI, and darray calls from ROMIO.
* Set -DHAVE_STATUS_SET_BYTES in configure and configure.in, and
  add status setting call in adio/common/status_setb.c
* Extended the ADIOI_Datatype_iscontig stub so that count == 0 types
  are considered contiguous. (Needed for HDF5's parallel tests.)
* Use AMPI's AMPI_Type_is_contiguous() extension in adio/common/iscontig.c
  (currently disabled pending review of CkDDT's contiguity handling)
* Excluded directories doc, lib, man, and test in the distribution.
  (lib will be generated in the building directory $CHARMDIR/tmp/)
* Global variables were privatized, as shown in the section below.
* Function declarations have been moved from mpio.h.in to a new file,
  mpio_functions.h, in line with ampi_functions.h. As part of this,
  the mpi.h include has been moved to the bottom of mpio.h.in, and one
  item that depends on mpi.h typedefs has been moved to ampi.h.
* HAVE_MPI_OFFSET is unconditionally defined to 1.
* MPIR_Ext_cs_yield has been corrected to ROMIO_THREAD_CS_YIELD in
  adio/common/ad_i{read,write}_coll.c.
* PMPI_File_set_errhandler has been corrected to MPI_File_set_errhandler
  in adio/common/ad_end.c and mpi-io/close.c.
* MPIO_Request_{c2f,f2c} are declared regardless of HAVE_MPI_GREQUEST
  and mpi-io/ioreq_{c2f,f2c}.c are always built. See mpio_functions.h
  and mpi-io/Makefile.mk.
* Building of mpi-io/{get,set}_errh.c has been temporarily enabled in
  order to provide MPI_File_{get,set}_errhandler. See mpi-io/Makefile.mk.
* PMPI function declarations in mpio_functions.h have been disabled.
  This does not affect PMPI functionality.
* MPI_Type_size_x and MPI_Status_set_elements_x in large_count.c are ifdef'd
  out, since they are provided by AMPI, but the ROMIO configure check for their
  presence is faulty.
* The objects that define Fortran APIs are compiled as a single object.
* Use `ACLOCAL=aclocal-1.15 AUTOMAKE=automake-1.15 autoreconf` to regenerate
  the configure script if making additional changes.


Variable privatization
======================

ROMIO has several global variables that need to be privatized for AMPI.
The following table contains the currently known global variables and how they
are handled in this integrated version of ROMIO. Privatization is done manually
by including the globals in the ampiParent class.

The nm types are as follows:
B - The symbol is in the uninitialized data section (BSS).
D - The symbol is in the initialized data section.
G - The symbol is in the initialized data section for small objects.
S - The symbol is in the uninitialized data section for small objects.
