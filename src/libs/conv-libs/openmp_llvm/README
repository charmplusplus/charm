LLVM OpenMP library integrated with Converse.

All the changes made in this project for the integration are enclosed with a flag, "CHARM_OMP"

BASE REVISION
=============
This library has been forked from LLVM OpenMP Library. 
(git repo: https://github.com/llvm-mirror/openmp)
The base revision is 8c08442bf910dffc8564d6647f04fc2110f24122 in git.

LIST OF MODIFIED FILES
======================
The following is the list of modified codes from the LLVM OpenMP library to make it work with Converse.
runtime/src/CMakeLists.txt
runtime/src/kmp.h
runtime/src/kmp_barrier.cpp
runtime/src/kmp_config.h.cmake
runtime/src/kmp_global.cpp
runtime/src/kmp_os.h
runtime/src/kmp_runtime.cpp
runtime/src/kmp_settings.cpp
runtime/src/kmp_wait_release.h
runtime/src/z_Linux_util.cpp

The following codes are added to plug the LLVM OpenMP library into the Converse. 
runtime/ompcharm/Makefile
runtime/ompcharm/OmpCharm.C
runtime/ompcharm/OmpCharm.ci
runtime/src/ompcharm.h

BUILD INSTRUCTION
=================
This library is built only with SMP mode of Charm++ or AMPI.
You can build this library with 'omp' keyword. 
e.g.) $(CHARMDIR)/build charm++ multicore-linux64 omp (This library is built with multicore version of Charm++: Single-node SMP version of Charm++) 
      $(CHARMDIR)/build charm++ netlrts-linux-x86_64 smp omp (This integrations is built with netlrts version in SMP mode.)

If you want to build this library again after the Charm++ or AMPI is built and you make some changes in the source codes, 
   you can rebuild this library incrementally by 'make openmp_llvm' in $(CHARMDIR)/tmp.
