* Configuration

Configure with

	./configure operating-system-and-compiler

Where operating-system-and-compiler is one of the supported
configurations.  You can list the supported configurations by listing
the contents of the mkfiles subdirectory.  (Note: as of May 1997, many
of those makefiles are untested.  The C and assembly language is fine,
but the makefiles themselves may not work.  You may need to do some
minor repairs.)  If you don't see your machine listed, don't despair:
usually, all you have to do is write a new makefile.  Find a makefile
for a system with the same CPU as yours.  Copy it, and edit it until
it works with your system.  If that doesn't work, try switching to the
generic version.  Copy the generic makefile, and edit that one until
it compiles.  If that fails too (very unlikely), you may have an
actual porting effort on your hands.

* Build

To build the QuickThreads library, first configure (see above) then
type `make' in the top-level directory.  This also builds the
demonstration threads package, SimpleThreads, and the stress-test
program.

* Installation

Build the QuickThreads library (see above) and then copy `libqt.a' to
the installation library directory (e.g., /usr/local/lib) and `qt.h'
and `qtmd.h' to the installation include directory (e.g.,
/usr/local/include).
