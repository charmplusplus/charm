/**
 * ShedLB: threshold refinement that minimises MIGRATED BYTES.
 *
 * The objective is not "balance" and not "few moves" but the one that
 * actually costs time when objects carry device state: move as few bytes as
 * possible subject to no bin exceeding (1 + eps) times the mean load.
 *
 * Every bin above the threshold sheds down to it and nothing else is touched.
 * A bin picks what to shed locally, taking objects in descending load per
 * byte, so it clears its excess for the fewest bytes. The shed objects form a
 * pool, which is placed on bins under the threshold by best fit on load.
 *
 * Two properties follow, and they are why this exists alongside
 * GreedyRefineCentralLB:
 *
 *  - Any algorithm that brings every bin under T must move at least the total
 *    excess above T, because that load has nowhere else to live. This one
 *    moves at most that excess plus, in the worst case, one object per
 *    overloaded bin, since the last object shed can overshoot. So it is
 *    optimal on migrated volume up to a granularity term that does not grow
 *    with the number of objects. A repacking strategy has no such bound: it
 *    re-derives the whole assignment and its move count is whatever the
 *    packing order happens to produce.
 *
 *  - The shed decision is local to each overloaded bin. Only the pool needs a
 *    global view, and the pool is bounded by the excess, not by the object
 *    count. That is what makes the algorithm a candidate for a distributed
 *    implementation later; this one is central, so it does not yet realise
 *    that, but the structure is kept explicit so it can be lifted.
 *
 * Under CUDA a bin is a GPU (the set of available PEs sharing a
 * gpu_device_id) and the balanced quantity is device time, with host time
 * deciding only which PE inside the group runs an object. Otherwise a bin is
 * a PE and the quantity is host time.
 *
 * eps is +LBShedEps, default 0.02. It cannot usefully go below the largest
 * object's share of the mean: with indivisible objects no assignment beats
 * the largest one, which is the regime where the answer is to split or
 * replicate the object rather than place it.
