What's new in Charm++ 6.7.1
================================================================================

Changes in this release are primarily bug fixes for 6.7.0. The major exception
is AMPI, which has seen changes to its extension APIs and now complies with more
of the MPI standard. A brief list of changes follows:

Charm++ Bug Fixes

- Startup and exit sequences are more robust

- Error and warning messages are generally more informative

- CkMulticast's set and concat reducers work correctly

AMPI Features

- AMPI's extensions have been renamed to use the prefix AMPI_ instead of MPI_
  and to generally follow MPI's naming conventions

- AMPI_Migrate(MPI_Info) is now used for dynamic load balancing and all fault
  tolerance schemes (see the AMPI manual)

- AMPI officially supports MPI-2.2, and also implements the non-blocking
  collectives and neighborhood collectives from MPI-3.1

Platforms and Portability

- Cray regularpages build target has been fixed

- Clang compiler target for BlueGene/Q systems added

- Comm. thread tracing for SMP mode added

- AMPI's compiler wrappers are easier to use with autoconf and cmake

================================================================================
What's new in Charm++ 6.7.0
================================================================================

Over 120 bugs fixed, spanning areas across the entire system

Charm++ Features

- New API for efficient formula-based distributed spare array creation

- CkLoop is now built by default

- CBase_Foo::pup need not be called from Foo::pup in user code anymore - runtime
  code handles this automatically

- Error reporting and recovery in .ci files is greatly improved, providing more
  precise line numbers and often column information

- Many data races occurring under shared-memory builds (smp, multicore) were
  fixed, facilitating use of tools like ThreadSanitizer and Helgrind

AMPI Enhancements

- Further MPI standard compliance in AMPI allows users to build and run
  Hypre-2.10.1 on AMPI with virtualization, migration, etc.

- Improved AMPI Fortran2003 PUP interface 'apup', similiar to C++'s STL PUP

Platforms and Portability

- Compiling Charm++ now requires support for C++11 variadic templates. In GCC,
  this became available with version 4.3, released in 2008

- New machine target for multicore Linux ARM7: multicore-linux-arm7

- Preliminary support for POWER8 processors, in preparation for the upcoming
  Summit and Sierra supercomputers

- The charmrun process launcher is now much more robust in the face of slow
  or rate-limited connections to compute nodes

- PXSHM now auto-detects the node size, so the '+nodesize' is no longer needed

- Out-of-tree builds are now supported

Deprecations

- CommLib has been removed.

- CmiBool has been dropped in favor of C++'s bool


================================================================================

  * The long-unsupported FEM library has been deprecated in favor of ParFUM
  * The CmiBool typedefs have been deleted, as C++ bool has long been universal
  * Future versions of the runtime system and libraries will require some degree
    of support for C++11 features from compilers

================================================================================
What's new in Charm++ 6.5.0
================================================================================

- The Charm++ manual has been thoroughly revised to improve its organization,
  comprehensiveness, and clarity, with many additional example code snippets
  throughout.

- The runtime system now includes the 'Metabalancer', which can provide
  substantial performance improvements for applications that exhibit dynamic
  load imbalance. It provides two primary benefits. First, it automatically
  optimizes the frequency of load balancer invocation, to avoid work stoppage
  when it will provide too little benefit. Second, calls to AtSync() are made
  less synchronous, to further reduce overhead when the load balancer doesn't
  need to run. To activate the Metabalancer, pass the option +MetaLB at
  runtime. To get the full benefits, calls to AtSync() should be made at every
  iteration, rather than at some arbitrary longer interval as was previously
  common.

- Many feature additions and usability improvements have been made in the
  interface translator that generates code from .ci files:
  * Charmxi now provides much better error reports, including more accurate
    line numbers and clearer reasons for failure, including some semantic
    problems that would otherwise appear when compiling the C++ code or even at
    runtime.
  * A new SDAG construct 'case' has been added that defines a disjunction over a
    set of 'when' clauses: only one 'when' out of a set will ever be triggered.
  * Entry method templates are now supported. An example program can be found
    in tests/charm++/method_templates/.
  * SDAG keyword "atomic" has been deprecated in favor of the newly supported
    keyword "serial". The two are synonymous, but "atomic" is now provided only
    for backward compatibility.
  * It is no longer necessary to call __sdag_init() in chares that contain SDAG
    code - the generated code does this automatically. The function is left as
    a no-op for compatibility, but may be removed in a future version.
  * Code generated from .ci files is now primarily in .def.h files, with only
    declarations in .decl.h. This improves debugging, speeds compilation,
    provides clearer compiler output, and enables more complete encapsulation,
    especially in SDAG code.
  * Mainchare constructors are expected to take CkArgMsg*, and always have
    been. However, charmxi would allow declarations with no argument, and
    assume the message. This is now deprecated, and generates a warning.

- Projections tracing has been extended and improved in various ways
  * The trace module can generate a record of network topology of the nodes in
    a run for certain platforms (including Cray), which Projections can
    visualize.
  * If the gzip library (libz) is available when Charm++ is compiled, traces
    are compressed by default.
  * If traces were flushed as a results of filled buffers during the run, a
    warning will be printed at exit to indicate that the user should be wary of
    interference that may have resulted.
  * In SMP builds, it is now possible to trace message progression through the
    communication threads. This is disabled by default to avoid overhead and
    potential misleading interpretation.

- Array elements can be block-mapped at the SMP node level instead of at the
  per-PE level (option "+useNodeBlkMapping").

- AMPI can now privatize global and static variables using TLS. This is
  supported in C and C++ with __thread markings on the variable declarations
  and definitions, and in Fortran with a patched version of the gfortran
  compiler. To activate this feature, append '-tls' to the '-thread' option's
  argument when you link your AMPI program.

- Charm can now be built to only support message priorities of a specific data
  type. This enables an optimized message queue within the the runtime
  system. Typical applications with medium sized compute grains may not benefit
  noticeably when switching to the new scheduler. However, this may permit
  further optimizations in later releases.

  The new queue is enabled by specifying the data type of the message
  priorities while building charm using --with-prio-type=dtype. Here, dtype can
  be one of char, short, int, long, float, double and bitvec. Specifying bitvec
  will permit arbitrary-length bitvector priorities, and is the current default
  mode of operation. However, we may change this in a future release.

- Converse now provides a complete set of wrappers for
  fopen/fread/fwrite/fclose to handle EINTR, which is not uncommon on the
  increasingly-popular Lustre. They are named CmiF{open,read,write,close}, and
  are available from C and C++ code.

- The utility class 'CkEntryOptions' now permits method chaining for cleaner
  usage. This applies to all its set methods (setPriority, setQueueing,
  setGroupDepID). Example usage can be found in examples/charm++/prio/pgm.C.

- When creating groups or chare arrays that depend on the previous construction
  of another such entity on the local PE, it is now possible to declare that
  dependence to the runtime. Creation messages whose dependence is not yet
  satisfied will be buffered until it is.

- For any given chare class Foo and entry method Bar, the supporting class's
  member CkIndex_Foo::Bar() is used to lookup/specify the entry method
  index. This release adds a newer API for such members where the argument is a
  function pointer of the same signature as the entry method. Those new
  functions are used like CkIndex_Foo::idx_Bar(&Foo::Bar). This permits entry
  point index lookup without instantiating temporary variables just to feed the
  CkIndex_Foo::Bar() methods. In cases where Foo::Bar is overloaded, &Foo::Bar
  must be cast to the desired type to disambiguate it.

- CkReduction::reducerType now have PUP methods defined; and can hence be
  passed as parameter-marshalled arguments to entry methods.

- The runtime option +stacksize for controlling the allocation of user-level
  threads' stacks now accepts shorthanded annotation such as 1M.

- The -optimize flag to the charmc compiler wrapper now passes more aggressive
  options to the various underlying compilers than the previous '-O'.

- The charmc compiler wrapper now provides a flag -use-new-std to enable
  support for C11 and C++11 where available. To use this in application code,
  the runtime system must have been built with that flag as well.

- When using, CmiMemoryUsage(), the runtime can be instructed not to use the
  underlying mallinfo() library call, which can be inaccurate in settings where
  usage exceeds INT_MAX. This is accomplished by setting the environment
  variable "MEMORYUSAGE_NO_MALLINFO".

- Experimental Features
  * Initial implementation of a fast message-logging protocol. Use option
    'mlogft' to build it.
  * Message compression support for persistent message on Gemini machine layer.
  * Node-level inter-PE loop/task parallelization is now supported through
    CkLoop
  * New temperature/CPU frequency aware load balancer
  * Support interoperation of Charm++ and native MPI code through dynamically
    switching control between the two
  * API in centralized load balancers to get and set PE speed
  * A new scheme for optimization of double in-memory checkpoint/restart.
  * Message combining library for improved fine-grained communication
    performance
  * Support for partitioning of allocated nodes into subsets that run
    independent Charm++ instances but can interact with each other.

Platform-Specific Changes
-------------------------

- Cray XE/XK
  * The gemini_gni network layer has been heavily tuned and optimized,
    providing substantial improvements in performance, scalability, and
    stability.
  * The gemini_gni-crayxe machine layer supports a 'hugepages' option at build
    time, rather than requiring manual configuration file editing.
  * Persistent message optimizations can be used to reduce latency and
    overheads
  * Experimental support for 'urgent' sends, which are sent ahead of any other
    outgoing messages queued for transmission.

- IBM Blue Gene Q: Experimental machine-layer support for the native PAMI
  interface and MPI, with and without SMP support. This supports many new
  systems, including LLNL's Sequoia, ALCF's Mira, and FZ Juelich's Juqueen.

  There are three network-layer implementations for these systems: 'mpi',
  'pami', and 'pamilrts'. The 'mpi' layer is stable, but its performance and
  scalability suffers from the additional overhead of using MPI rather than
  driving the interconnect directly. The 'pami' layer is well tested for NAMD,
  but has shown instability for other applications. It is likely to be replaced
  by the 'pamilrts' layer, which is more generally stable and seems to provide
  the same performance, in the next release.

  In addition to the common 'smp' option to build the runtime system with
  shared memory support, there is an 'async' option which sometimes provides
  better performance on SMP builds. This option passes tests on 'pamilrts', but
  is still experimental.

  Note: Applications that have large number of messages may crash in default
  setup due to overflow in the low-level FIFOs. Environment variables
  MUSPI_INJFIFOSIZE and PAMI_RGETINJFIFOSIZE can be set to avoid application
  failures due to large number of small and large messages respectively. The
  default value of these variable is 65536 which is sufficient for 1000
  messages in flight.

- Infiniband Verbs: Better support for more flavors of ibverbs libraries

- MPI Network Layer
  * Experimental rendezvous protocol for better performance above some MPI
    implementations.
  * Some tuning parameters ("+dynCapSend" and "+dynCapRecv") are now
    configurable at job launch, rather than Charm++ compilation.

- PGI C++: Disable automatic 'using namespace std;'

- Charm++ now supports ARM, both non-smp and smp.

- Mac OS X: Compilation options to build and link correctly on newer versions

================================================================================
What's New since Charm++ 5.4 release 1
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Supported Platforms:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Charm++ ported to IA64 Itanium running Win2K and Linux, Charm++ also support
   Intel C/C++ compilers;

2. Charm++ ported to Power Macintosh powerpc running Darwin;

3. Charm++ ported to Myrinet networking with GM API;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of New Features:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Structure Dagger
   Structured Dagger is a coordination language built on top of CHARM++.
   Structured Dagger allows easy expression of dependences among messages and 
   computations and also among computations within the same object using 
   when-blocks and various structured constructs. 

2. Entry functions support parameter marshalling
   Now you can declare and invoke remote entry functions using parameter 
   marshalling instead of defining messages.

3. Easier running - standalone mode
   For net-* version running locally, you can now run Charm programs without 
   charmrun. Running a node program directly from command line is now the
   same as "charmrun +p1 <program>"; for SMP version, you can also specify 
   multiple (local) processors, as in "program +p2".
   

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of Changes:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. "build" changed for compilation of Charm++
   To build Charm++ from scratch, we now take additional command line options
   to compile with addon features and using different compilers other than gcc.
   For example, to build Linux IA64 with Myrinet support, type command:
   ./build net-linux-ia64  gm


                *******   Old Change histories *******


================================================================================
What's New in Charm++ 5.4 release 1 since 5.0
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Supported Platforms:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Win9x/2000/NT:  with Visual C++ or Cygwin gcc/g++, you can compile and run 
   Charm++ programs on all Win32 platforms.
   
2. Scyld Beowulf:  Charm++ has been ported to the Linux-based Scyld Beowulf 
   operating system. For more information on Scyld, see <http://www.scyld.com>

3. MPI with VMI:   Charm++ has been ported to NCSA's Virtual Machine Interface,
   which is an efficient messaging library for heterogeneous cluster 
   communication.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of New Features:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Dynamic Load balancing:
   Chare migration is supported in the new release. Migration-based dynamic 
   load balancing framework with various load balancing strategies library has 
   been added.

2. Chare Array
   Charm++ array is supported. You can now create an array of Chare objects
   and use array index to refer the Charm++ array elements. A reduction
   library on top of Chare array has been implemented and included.

3. Projections
   Projections, a Java application for Charm++ program performance analysis and 
   visualization, has been included and distributed in the new release. Two
   trace modes are available: trace-projections and trace-summary. Trace-summary
   is a light-weight trace library compared to trace-projections.

4. AMPI
   AMPI is a load-balancing based library for porting legacy MPI applications 
   to Charm++. With few changes in the original MPI code to AMPI, the new
   legacy MPI application on Charm++ will gain from Charm++'s adptive 
   load balancing ability.

5. Easier invocation
   "Charmrun" is now available on all platforms, with a uniform command line 
   syntax. You can forget the difference between net-* versions and MPI versions,
   and run charm++ application with this same charmrun command syntax. 
   ++local option is added in charmrun for net-* version, it provides
   simple local use of Charm and no longer require the ability to 
   "rsh localhost" or a nodelist file in order to run charm only on the local
   machine. This is especially attractive when you run Charm++ on Windows.

6. New libraries:
   Many new libraries have been added in this release. They include:
   1) master-slave library: for writing manager-worker paradigm programs.
   2) receiver library: provide asynchronous communication mode for chare array.
   3) f90charm:  provides Fortran90 bindings for Charm++ Array.
   4) BlueGene:  a Charm++/Converse emulator for IBM proposed Blue Gene.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of Changes:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. message declaration syntax in .ci file:
   The message declaration syntax for packed/varsize messages has been changed.
   The packed/varsize keywords are eliminated, and you can specify the actual
   actual varsize arrays in the interface file and have the translator generate
   alloc, pack and unpack.

12/21/1999	skumar2		New LB strategy: CommLB
01/03/2000	rbrunner	New LB strategy: RecBisectBfLB
01/08/2000	skumar2		New LB strategy: Comm1LB, with varying processor
				speeds
01/18/2000	milind		Modified SM library syntax, and added a test
				program for SM.
01/19/2000	gzheng		Added irecv, a library to simplify conversion
				of message-passing programs to Charm++
02/20/2000	olawlor		Added preliminary broadcast support to Charm++
				arrays.
02/23/2000	paranjpy	Added converse-level quiescence detection
03/02/2000	milind		Added ++server-port option to pre-specify
				CCS port.
03/10/2000	wilmarth	Random seed-based load balancer now uses
				bit-vector for active PEs.
03/21/2000	gzheng		Added support for marking user-defined events 
				in trace-summary.
03/28/2000	wilmarth	Added CMK_TRUECRASH. Very helpful for
				post-mortem debugging of Charm++ programs on
				net-* versions.
03/31/2000	jdesouza	Added Fortran90 support to the Charm++ 
				interface translator.
03/09/2000	milind		Added support for -LANG and -rpath options 
				in charmc for Origin2000.
04/28/2000	milind		Added prioritized converse threads.
05/01/2000	milind		Added test programs for TeMPO, AMPI and irecv.
05/04/2000	milind		New supported platform: mpi-sp.
05/04/2000	gzheng		Added irecv pingpong program.
05/17/2000	olawlor		Each chare, group and array element now has to
				have migration constructor.
05/24/2000	milind		Added Jacobi3D programs for irecv and AMPI both.
05/24/2000	milind		Made migratable an optional attribute of 
				chares, groups, and nodegroups.  
				Arrays are by default migratable.
05/29/2000	paranjpy	Added pup methods to arrays, reductions etc 
				internal objects.
06/13/2000	milind		Made CtvInitialize idempotent.  That is, it 
				can be called by any number of threads now, 
				only the first one will actually do 
				CtvInitialize.
06/20/2000	milind		Added a simple test program for the FEM 
				framework.
07/06/2000	milind		Imported Metis 4.0 sources in the CVS tree. 
				Also added code to make metis libraries and 
				executables to Makefile.
07/07/2000	milind		Added more meaningfull error messages using 
				perror in addition to a cryptic error codes in
				net-* versions.
07/10/2000	milind		fem and femf are now recognized as "languages" 
				by charmc.
07/10/2000	saboo		Added the derived datatypes library.
07/13/2000	milind		Added +idle_timeout functionality. It takes a 
				commandline parameter denoting milliseconds of 
				maximum consecutive idle time allowed per 
				processor.
07/14/2000	milind		Added group multicast. Added 
				CkSendMsgBranchMulti, CldEnqueueMulti, and 
				translator changes to support it.
07/14/2000	milind		SUPER_INSTALL now takes "-*" arguments prior 
				to the target, that will be passed to make as 
				"makeflags". This makes it easy to suppress 
				make's output of commands etc (with the -s 
				flag). As a result of this, several Makefiles 
				have been massaged.
07/18/2000	milind		Added support for using "dbx" on suns as 
				debugger.
07/19/2000	milind		Added ability to tracemode projections which 
				produces binary trace files. Use flag 
				+binary-trace on the command line.
07/26/2000	milind		Separated AMPI from TeMPO.
07/28/2000	milind		Added test programs to test reduce, alltoall 
				and allreduce functionality of AMPI.
08/02/2000	milind		Added an option to let the user specify which 
				"xterm" to use.  For example, on some systems 
				(CDE), only dtterm is installed.  So, by 
				putting ++xterm dtterm on the conv-host 
				commandline, one can use dtterm when ++in-xterm
				option is specified on conv-host commandline.
08/14/2000	milind		FEM Framework: Added capabilities to handle 
				esoteric meshes to standalone offline programs.
				Makefile now produces gmap and fgmap programs, 
				which are used for this purpose.  They convert 
				the mesh to a graph before partitioning it 
				using Metis.
08/24/2000	milind		Added the 2D crack propagation program as a 
				test program for FEM framework.
08/25/2000	milind		Initial implementation of isomalloc-based 
				threads.  This implementation uses a fixed 
				stack size for all threads (can be set at 
				runtime.)
08/26/2000	milind		Added a macro CtvAccessOther that lets you 
				get/set a Ctv variable of any thread.  It 
				should be invoked as CtvAccessOther(thread,
				varname); Added CthGetData function to each of 
				the threads implementation.  This function is 
				used in the CtvAccessOther macro.
08/27/2000	milind		FEM Framework: Separated mesh to graph 
				conversion capability into a separate program.
				This way, the generated graph can be partitioned
				repeatedly.
09/04/2000	milind		Added the class static readonly variables to 
				ci file syntax.
09/05/2000	milind		FEM Framework: A very fast O(n) algorithm for 
				mesh2graph , uses more memory, but the tradeoff
				was worth it. Coded by Karthik Mahesh, minor 
				optimizations by Milind.
09/05/2000	milind		Added a barebones charm kernel scheduling 
				overhead measurement program.
09/15/2000	milind		Added pup support for AMPI and FEM framework.
09/20/2000	olawlor		Added capability to have an array of base type 
				where individual element could be of derived 
				types.
10/03/2000	gzheng		New supported platform: net-linux-axp
10/05/2000	skumar2		Added program littleMD to the test suite.
10/07/2000	skumar2		New job scheduler (Faucets projects).
10/15/2000	milind		Improved support for Fortran90 in charmc.
11/04/2000	jdesouza	Made the Faucets scheduler multi-threaded.
11/05/2000	olawlor		FEM Framework: supports multiple element types,
				mesh re-assembly, etc.
11/15/2000	gzheng		New platform support: net-cygwin
11/18/2000	gzheng		conv-host no longer needs /bin/csh to start 
				remote program.  set 
				CMK_CONV_HOST_CSH_UNAVAILABLE to 1 to use 
				/bin/sh instead.
11/25/2000	milind		Finished experimental implementation of 
				converse-threads based on co-operative pthreads.
11/25/2000	milind		Added a benchmark suite of all pingpongs in
				Charm++.
11/28/2000	milind		Removed deletion of _idx at the end of every 
				send or doneInserting call.  Instead now it is 
				in the destructor of the proxy. This allows us 
				to cache proxies, when proxy creation becomes 
				a bottleneck.
11/28/2000	olawlor		Added "seek blocks" to puppers.  This should 
				allow out-of-order pup'ing without the ugliness
				of getBuf; and in a way that works with all 
				PUP::ers.
11/29/2000	olawlor		Simplified and regularized command-line-argument
				handling.
11/29/2000	milind		AMPI: Added multiple-communicators capability.
12/05/2000	gzheng		Now /bin/sh is default shell to fork node 
				program on remote machines.
12/13/2000	olawlor		Added charmrun wrapper for poe on mpi-sp.
12/14/2000	milind		Added bluegene emulator sources and test 
				programs.  Added "bluegene" as a language known
				to charmc.  Makefile now has a target called 
				bluegene.  Added preliminary bluegene 
				documentation.  (copied from Arun's webpage.)
12/15/2000	gzheng		f90charm addition to Makefile and charmc. Also,
				added fixed size arrays support to f90charm. A 
				test program f90charm/hello is checked in.
12/17/2000	milind		Added rtest test program. Contributed by jim to
				test Converse message transmission.
12/20/2000	olawlor		Added charmconfig script. Enables automatic 
				determination of C++ compiler properties, 
				replacing the verbose and error-prone 
				conv-mach.h entries for CMK_BOOL, 
				CMK_STL_USE_DOT_H, CMK_CPP_CAST_OK, ...
12/20/2000	olawlor		Charm++ Arrays optimizations: Key and object 
				now variable-length fields, instead of pointers.
				This extra flexibility lets us save many 
				dynamic allocations in the array framework.
12/20/2000	olawlor		Added PUP::able support-- dynamic type 
				identification, allocation, and deletion.  
				Allows you to write:   p(objPtr); and 
				objPointer will be properly identified, 
				allocated, packed, and deallocated (depending 
				on the PUP::er).  Requires you to register any 
				such classes with DECLARE_PUPable and 
				DEFINE_PUPable.
12/20/2000	olawlor		Arrays optimizations: Made CkArrayIndex 
				fixed-size.  This significantly improves 
				messaging speed (7 us instead of 10 us 
				roundtrip).  Move spring cleaning check into a 
				CcdCallFnAfter, which gains more speed (down to
				4 us roundtrip).
12/20/2000	olawlor		More optimizations: Minor speed tweaks-- 
				conv-ccs.c uses hashtable for handler lookup; 
				conv-conds skips timer test until needed; 
				convcore.c scheduler loop optmizations (no 
				superfluous EndIdle calls); threads.c 
				CMK_OPTIMIZE-> no mprotect.
12/20/2000	olawlor		More Optimizations: Minor speed tweaks-- ck.C 
				groups cldEnqueue skip; init.h defines 
				CkLocalBranch inline; and supporting changes.
12/22/2000	gzheng		IA64 support for Converse user level threads.
01/02/2001	olawlor		CCS: Minor update-- enabled CcsProbe, cleaned 
				up superflous debug messages in server, added 
				Java interface (originally written for 
				AppSpecter).
01/09/2001	gzheng		charmconfig converted to autoconf style, need 
				to change configure.in and conv-autoconfig.h.in,
				and run autoconf to get configure and copy to 
				charmconfig.  added fortran subroutine name 
				test and get libpthread.a
01/10/2001	milind		Added telnet method of getting libpthread.a 
				from charm webserver.
01/11/2001	olawlor		Moved projections files here from 
				CVSROOT/projections-java.  Added fast Java 
				versions of the .log file input routines in 
				LogReader, LogLoader, LogAnalyzer, and 
				UsageCalc.  Added "U.java" user interface 
				utility file, allowing times to be input in 
				seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds, 
				instead of just microseconds.
01/15/2001	gzheng		add +trace-root to specify the directory to 
				put log files in. this is need in Scyld cluster
				where there is no NFS mounting and no i/o 
				access to home directory sharing on nodes.
01/15/2001	milind		Made AMPI into a f90 module instead of 
				'ampif.h' inclusion.  AMPI f90 bindings are 
				now more inclusive.  Fixed argc,argv handling 
				bugs in ArgsInfo message.  Fixed a bug in pup 
				that caused thread not to be sized, but was 
				packed nevertheless. Moved irecv to waitall 
				instead of at in ampi_start.  Made 
				AMPI_COMM_WORLD to be 0, because it clashed 
				with wildcard(-1).  AMPI_COMM_UNIVERSE is now 
				handled properly in the AMPI module.  
				C/C++ data members are NOT visible to 
				Fortran 90.
01/18/2001	gzheng		New supported platform: net-linux-scyld
01/20/2001	olawlor		Moved array index field from CMessage_* to the 
				Ck envelope itself.  This is the right thing 
				to do, because any message may be sent to/from 
				an array element.  To reduce the wasted space 
				in a message, a union is used to overlay the 
				fields for the various possible message types.
01/29/2001	olawlor		Freed charmrun on net-* version from using
				remote shell to fork off processes. One can now
				use a daemon provided in the distribution.
02/07/2001	olawlor		Added debugging support to puppers.
02/13/2000	gzheng		Added ++local option to charmrun to start node 
				program locally without any daemon; fix the 
				hang program if you type wrong pgm name in 
				scyld version, and redirect all output to 
				/dev/null, otherwise all node program can send 
				its output to console in scyld. Also implemented				++local in net-win32 version.
02/26/2000	milind		Changed the varsize syntax. Now one can specify
				actual varsize arrays in the interface file
				and have the translator generate alloc, pack 
				and unpack.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bug Fixes:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10/29/1999	milind		Replaced jmemcpy by memcpy in net versions, as
				it was causing a bit to flip (bug reported
				by jim.)
10/29/1999	milind		Fixed multiline macros in all header files.
02/05/2000	milind		Fixed linking errors by getting the order of
				libraries right from the charmc command-line.
02/18/2000	paranjpy	Fixed Charm++ initialization bug on SMPs.
02/21/2000	milind		Fixed a context-switching bug in mipspro version
				of QuickThreads.
02/25/2000	milind		Charm++ interface translator was segfaulting
				on interface file errors. Fixed that. Also,
				added linenumbers to error messages.
03/02/2000	milind		Made CCS work on SMPs.
03/07/2000	milind		Made ConverseInit consistent with the manual on
				Origin2000 version.
04/18/2000	milind		Fixed a bug in CkWaitFuture, which was caching 
				a variable locally, while it was changed by 
				another thread.
05/04/2000	paranjpy	Fixed argv deletion bug on net-win32-smp.
06/08/2000	milind	 	sp3 version: changed optimization flags, which 
				where power2 processor-specific.
06/20/2000	milind		mpi-* versions: Fixed ConverseExit since it was
				not obeying the following statement in the MPI 
				standard: The user must ensure that all pending
				communications involving a process completes 
				before the process calls MPI_FINALIZE.
07/05/2000	milind		Fixed a nasty bug in charmc in the -cp option. 
				It used to append the name provided to -o flag 
				to the directory provided to the -cp flag.  
				Thus, -o ../pgm -cp ../bin options meant that 
				the pgm would be copied to ../bin/.., which is 
				not the expected behavior. This fix correctly 
				copies pgm to ../bin.
07/07/2000	milind		Removed variable arg_myhome, as it was not 
				being used anywhere, and also, setting it was 
				causing problems of env var HOME was not set.
07/27/2000	milind		thishandle for the arrayelement was not being 
				correctly set.  Bug was reported by Neelam.
08/26/2000	milind		Origin2000: Changed the page alignment to 
				reflect the mmap alignment.  The mmap man page 
				specifically states that it is not the same as 
				page size.
09/02/2000	milind		Fixed a bug in code generated for threaded 
				(void) entry methods of array elements. The 
				dummy message that is passed to that method in 
				a thread has to be deleted before calling the 
				object method, because upon object method's 
				return, the thread might have migrated.
09/03/2000	olawlor		Minor fix-fixes: 1.) Change to LBObjid hash 
				function would fail for >4-int object indices.
				Replaced with proper function, which also 
				preserves the 1-int case.  2.) Array element 
				sends must go via the message queue to prevent 
				stack build-up for deep single-processor call 
				chains. These might happen, e.g., in a driver 
				element calling itself for the main time loop.
				Messages are now properly noted as sent, then 
				wait through the queue for delivery.  This 
				entailed minor reorganization of the message 
				delivery subsystem.
09/21/2000	olawlor		Tiny SMP thread fix-- registrations of a 
				thread-private variable now reserve space on 
				calls after the first.  This wastes space for 
				multiple CthInitialize's-- it's a quick hack to
				get threads working again on SMP versions.
10/16/2000	olawlor		A few CCS fixes:   -Added split-phase reply 
				(delay reply indefinitely)  -Cleaned up error
				handling -Pass user data as "void *" instead of
				"char *"
11/03/2000	wilmarth	Removed 0 size array allocation in Charm++ 
				quiescence detection.
11/20/2000	gzheng		Rewrote part of Fiber thread, including a bug 
				fix for a the non thread-safe function, and a 
				different fiber free strategy.
11/29/2000	gzheng		The LB init procedure tried to allocate 
				65536*160 as initial size, which is 10M memory 
				for communication table, which is too big. 
				Cut it down to roughly 1M, and it can expand 
				in later code.
12/05/2000	gzheng		In many cases, conv-host exits without print 
				out the error message from remote shell. try 
				to fix it by calling sync to flush the pipe 
				before exit 1.
12/10/2000	milind		net-linux: Made static linking the default 
				option because dynamic linking runtime causes 
				isomalloc threads to crash.
12/18/2000	milind		Increased portability of isomalloc threads by 
				removing dependence on alloca.
12/28/2000	milind		Fixed ctrl-getone abort bug on SMP.
12/28/2000	milind		Made _groupTable a pointer on which a 
				constructor is explicitly called.  Since it 
				was a Cpv variable, its constructor was not 
				called by default in case of an SMP version.
12/29/2000	olawlor		Prevent infinite copy constructor recursion on 
				Origin2000.
01/10/2001	olawlor		Added "explicit" keyword to remove ambiguity 
				for KCC, which was confused by the private 
				PUP::er(int) "cast" constructor and the operator
				|(PUP::er &p,T &t) into rejecting all operator|
				(int,int) as ambiguous.
2001/01/17	gzheng		fix the charmconfig bug on paragon-red: the 
				failure testing of fortran won't stop the 
				compilation.
01/20/2001	olawlor		Arrays reduction:  Fixed bug-- reduction may end
				because all contributors migrate away. 
01/29/2001	olawlor		Fix heap-corrupting bug-- call ->init() on 
				nodeGroupTable, which sets the "pending" 
				message queue to NULL.  This prevents a nasty 
				delete-unitialized-data bug later on.  Also 
				delayed queue creation until messages actually 
				arrive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation Changes:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

01/31/2000	milind		Installation manual: Fixed bugs pointed out by
				quantum TA
02/28/2000	wilmarth	Added a new look Charm++ manual.
06/20/2000	milind		Added pdflatex support to generate PDF versions
				of manuals from LaTeX sources.
12/05/2000	milind		Added Orion's FEM manual. Converted from HTML.
12/10/2000	milind		Added pplmanual.sty for all manuals.
12/17/2000	milind		Added master-slave library documentation to
				convext manual.
12/21/2000	saboo		Added DDT documentation.
01/02/2001	olawlor		Updated for new CCS version.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other Changes:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10/24/1999	olawlor		charmc is changed to Bourne shell script 
				instead of csh. All conv-mach.csh are
				replaced by conv-mach.sh.
10/25/1999	olawlor		SUPER_INSTALL is converted to use bourne shell.
10/28/1999	milind		All Makefiles now take OPTS commandline
				arguments.
01/16/2000	olawlor		Simplified Charm++ interface translator.
02/23/2000	ruiliu		Changed rand() calls from all over the codes
				to the new Converse random number generator.
02/26/2000	milind		Simplified the converse scheduler loop by 
				combining the maxmsgs and poll modes.
08/31/2000	milind		Imported system documentation into the CVS tree.
				Also added super_install target for docs with 
				necessary Makefile modifications.
09/08/2000	olawlor		Made soft links use relative pathnames instead 
				of absolute.  This lets you move a charm++ 
				installation without having to recompile 
				anything.
09/11/2000	olawlor		Grouped commonly needed code in the new util
				directory. Also, added pup_c a C wrapper for
				puppers.
09/11/2000	olawlor		Slightly reorganized header structure.  Now no 
				headers should need to be listed twice (once in
				ALLHEADERS, again in CKHEADERS).  Now headers 
				are soft-linked instead of copied.  This makes 
				development much easier.  Added support for the
				new Common/util directory.
09/21/2000	olawlor		Major reorganization of net-* codes. Now all 
				the TCP socket routines are in separate files.
				Also combined windoes NT code with unix codes.
09/21/2000	olawlor		Major rewrite of CCS-- underlying protocol is 
				now binary (send/recv binary data everywhere); 
				conv-host forwards requests to nodes; and 
				source has been significantly re-arranged.  
				(especially if NODE_0_IS_CONVHOST).
11/22/2000	milind		Removed IDL translator from distribution.
12/01/2000	olawlor		Renamed conv-host charmrun; added test for 
				script conv-host. Also added charmrun for most 
				other machines.
12/17/2000	milind		Moved List related data structures into 
				cklists.h in util. Removed most of the redundant
				list implementations.
12/20/2000	gzheng		SUPER_INSTALL: format the output of list of 
				versions and make the help page fit into one 
				page of xterm.
12/24/2000	milind		Added test-{charm,converse,ampi,fem} targets to 
				super_install.
12/28/2000	milind		net-sol-smp now uses pthreads.
01/29/2001	olawlor		Merged windowsNT and unix build procedures by
				basing the Windows build on cygwin. Added 
				scripts to deal with unix and windows 
				differences.
