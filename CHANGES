================================================================================
What's new in Charm++ 6.2.0 (since 6.1)
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Supported Platforms:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

64-bit MIPS, such as SiCortex, using mpi-linux-mips64

Windows HPC cluster, using mpi-win32/mpi-win64

Mac OSX 10.6, Snow Leopard (32-bit and 64-bit).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General Changes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Runtime support
 - Smarter build/configure scripts
 - A new interface for model-based load balancing
 - new CPU topology API
 - a general implementation of CmiMemoryUsage()
 - Bug fix: Quiescence detection (QD) works with immediate messages
 - New reduction functions implemented in Converse
 - CCS (Converse Client-Server) can deliver message to more than one processor
 - Added a memory-aware adaptive scheduler, which can be optionally
   compiled in to charm
 - Added preliminary support for automatic message prioritization
   (disabled by default)

Charm++
 - Cross-array and cross-group sections
 - Structured Dagger (SDAG): Support templated arguments properly
 - Plain chares support checkpoint/restart (both in-memory and disk-based)
 - Conditional packing of messages and parameters in SMP scenario
 - Changes to the CkArrayIndex class hierarchy
   -- sizeof() all CkArrayIndex* classes is now the same
   -- Codes using custom array indices have to use placement-new to construct
      their custom index. Refer example code: examples/charm++/hello/fancyarray/
   -- *** Backward Incompatibility ***
      CkArrayIndex[4D/5D/6D]::index are now of type int (instead of short)
      However the data is stored as shorts. Access by casting
      CkArrayIndexND::data() appropriately
   -- *** Deprecated ***
      The direct use of public data member
      CkArrayIndexND::index (N=1..6) is deprecated. We reserve the right to
      change/remove this variable in future releases of Charm++.
      Instead, please access the indices via member function:
      int CkArrayIndexND::data()

Adaptive MPI (AMPI)
 - Compilers renamed to avoid collision with host MPI (ampicc, ampiCC,
   ampif77, ampif90)
 - Improved MPI standard conformance, and documentation of non-conformance
   * Bug fixes in: MPI_Ssend, MPI_Cart_shift, MPI_Get_count
   * Support MPI_IN_PLACE in MPI_(All)Reduce
   * Define various missing constants
 - Return the received message's tag in response to a non-blocking
   wildcard receive, to support SuperLU
 - Improved tracing for BigSim

Multiphase Shared Arrays (MSA)
 - Typed handles to enforce phases
 - Split-phase synchronization to enable message-driven execution
 - 3D arrays

TCharm
 - Automatic tracing of API calls for simulation and analysis

Debugging
 - Wider support for architectures other than net- (in particular MPI layers)
 - Improved support for large scale debugging (better scalability)
 - Enhanced record/replay stability to handle various events, and to
   signal unexpected messages
 - New detailed record/replay: The full content of messages can be
   recorded, and a single processor can be re-executed outside of the
   parallel application

Performance analysis
 - Tracing of nested entry methods

Automatic Performance Tuning
 - Created an automatic tuning framework [still for experimental use only]

CkMulticast
 - Network-topology / node aware spanning trees used internally for and
   lower bytes on the network and improved performance in multicasts and
   reductions delegated to this library

Comlib
 - Improved OneTimeMulticastStrategy classes

BigSim
 - Out-of-core support, with prefetching capability
 - Detailed tracing of MPI calls
 - Detailed record/replay support at emulation time, capable of
   replaying any emulated processor after obtained recorded logs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Architecture-specific changes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Net-*
 - Can run jobs with more than 1024 PEs

Net-Linux
 - New charmrun option ++no-va-randomization to disable address space
   randomization (ASLR). This is most useful for running AMPI with

   need to set BGP_INSTALL=/bgsys/drivers/V1R4M1_460_2009-091110P/ppc in your
   environment. This is the default on ANL's Surveyor.

Cray XT
 - cputopology information is now available on XT3/4/5

Infiniband (ibverbs)
 - Bug fix: plug memory leaks that caused failures in long runs
 - Optimized to reduce startup delays

LAPI
 - Support for SMP (experimental)


================================================================================
Note that changes from 5.9, 6.0, and 6.1 are not documented here. A partial list
can be found on the charm download page, or by reading through version control
logs.

================================================================================
What's New since Charm++ 5.4 release 1
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Supported Platforms:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Charm++ ported to IA64 Itanium running Win2K and Linux, Charm++ also support
   Intel C/C++ compilers;

2. Charm++ ported to Power Macintosh powerpc running Darwin;

3. Charm++ ported to Myrinet networking with GM API;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of New Features:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Structure Dagger
   Structured Dagger is a coordination language built on top of CHARM++.
   Structured Dagger allows easy expression of dependences among messages and 
   computations and also among computations within the same object using 
   when-blocks and various structured constructs. 

2. Entry functions support parameter marshalling
   Now you can declare and invoke remote entry functions using parameter 
   marshalling instead of defining messages.

3. Easier running - standalone mode
   For net-* version running locally, you can now run Charm programs without 
   charmrun. Running a node program directly from command line is now the
   same as "charmrun +p1 <program>"; for SMP version, you can also specify 
   multiple (local) processors, as in "program +p2".
   

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of Changes:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. "build" changed for compilation of Charm++
   To build Charm++ from scratch, we now take additional command line options
   to compile with addon features and using different compilers other than gcc.
   For example, to build Linux IA64 with Myrinet support, type command:
   ./build net-linux-ia64  gm


                *******   Old Change histories *******


================================================================================
What's New in Charm++ 5.4 release 1 since 5.0
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Supported Platforms:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Win9x/2000/NT:  with Visual C++ or Cygwin gcc/g++, you can compile and run 
   Charm++ programs on all Win32 platforms.
   
2. Scyld Beowulf:  Charm++ has been ported to the Linux-based Scyld Beowulf 
   operating system. For more information on Scyld, see <http://www.scyld.com>

3. MPI with VMI:   Charm++ has been ported to NCSA's Virtual Machine Interface,
   which is an efficient messaging library for heterogeneous cluster 
   communication.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of New Features:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Dynamic Load balancing:
   Chare migration is supported in the new release. Migration-based dynamic 
   load balancing framework with various load balancing strategies library has 
   been added.

2. Chare Array
   Charm++ array is supported. You can now create an array of Chare objects
   and use array index to refer the Charm++ array elements. A reduction
   library on top of Chare array has been implemented and included.

3. Projections
   Projections, a Java application for Charm++ program performance analysis and 
   visualization, has been included and distributed in the new release. Two
   trace modes are available: trace-projections and trace-summary. Trace-summary
   is a light-weight trace library compared to trace-projections.

4. AMPI
   AMPI is a load-balancing based library for porting legacy MPI applications 
   to Charm++. With few changes in the original MPI code to AMPI, the new
   legacy MPI application on Charm++ will gain from Charm++'s adptive 
   load balancing ability.

5. Easier invocation
   "Charmrun" is now available on all platforms, with a uniform command line 
   syntax. You can forget the difference between net-* versions and MPI versions,
   and run charm++ application with this same charmrun command syntax. 
   ++local option is added in charmrun for net-* version, it provides
   simple local use of Charm and no longer require the ability to 
   "rsh localhost" or a nodelist file in order to run charm only on the local
   machine. This is especially attractive when you run Charm++ on Windows.

6. New libraries:
   Many new libraries have been added in this release. They include:
   1) master-slave library: for writing manager-worker paradigm programs.
   2) receiver library: provide asynchronous communication mode for chare array.
   3) f90charm:  provides Fortran90 bindings for Charm++ Array.
   4) BlueGene:  a Charm++/Converse emulator for IBM proposed Blue Gene.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of Changes:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. message declaration syntax in .ci file:
   The message declaration syntax for packed/varsize messages has been changed.
   The packed/varsize keywords are eliminated, and you can specify the actual
   actual varsize arrays in the interface file and have the translator generate
   alloc, pack and unpack.

				Arrays are by default migratable.
05/29/2000	paranjpy	Added pup methods to arrays, reductions etc 
				internal objects.
06/13/2000	milind		Made CtvInitialize idempotent.  That is, it 
				can be called by any number of threads now, 
				only the first one will actually do 
				CtvInitialize.
06/20/2000	milind		Added a simple test program for the FEM 
				framework.
07/06/2000	milind		Imported Metis 4.0 sources in the CVS tree. 
				Also added code to make metis libraries and 
				executables to Makefile.
07/07/2000	milind		Added more meaningfull error messages using 
				perror in addition to a cryptic error codes in
				net-* versions.
07/10/2000	milind		fem and femf are now recognized as "languages" 
				by charmc.
07/10/2000	saboo		Added the derived datatypes library.
07/13/2000	milind		Added +idle_timeout functionality. It takes a 
				commandline parameter denoting milliseconds of 
				maximum consecutive idle time allowed per 
				processor.
07/14/2000	milind		Added group multicast. Added 
				CkSendMsgBranchMulti, CldEnqueueMulti, and 
				translator changes to support it.
07/14/2000	milind		SUPER_INSTALL now takes "-*" arguments prior 
				to the target, that will be passed to make as 
				"makeflags". This makes it easy to suppress 
				make's output of commands etc (with the -s 
				flag). As a result of this, several Makefiles 
				have been massaged.
07/18/2000	milind		Added support for using "dbx" on suns as 
				debugger.
07/19/2000	milind		Added ability to tracemode projections which

				and allreduce functionality of AMPI.
08/02/2000	milind		Added an option to let the user specify which 
				"xterm" to use.  For example, on some systems 
				(CDE), only dtterm is installed.  So, by 
				putting ++xterm dtterm on the conv-host 
				commandline, one can use dtterm when ++in-xterm
				option is specified on conv-host commandline.
08/14/2000	milind		FEM Framework: Added capabilities to handle 
				esoteric meshes to standalone offline programs.
				Makefile now produces gmap and fgmap programs, 
				which are used for this purpose.  They convert 
				the mesh to a graph before partitioning it 
				using Metis.
08/24/2000	milind		Added the 2D crack propagation program as a 
				test program for FEM framework.
08/25/2000	milind		Initial implementation of isomalloc-based 
				threads.  This implementation uses a fixed 
				stack size for all threads (can be set at 
				runtime.)
08/26/2000	milind		Added a macro CtvAccessOther that lets you 
				get/set a Ctv variable of any thread.  It 
				should be invoked as CtvAccessOther(thread,
				varname); Added CthGetData function to each of 
				the threads implementation.  This function is 
				used in the CtvAccessOther macro.
08/27/2000	milind		FEM Framework: Separated mesh to graph 
				conversion capability into a separate program.
				This way, the generated graph can be partitioned
				repeatedly.
09/04/2000	milind		Added the class static readonly variables to 
				ci file syntax.
09/05/2000	milind		FEM Framework: A very fast O(n) algorithm for 
				mesh2graph , uses more memory, but the tradeoff
				was worth it. Coded by Karthik Mahesh, minor 
				optimizations by Milind.
09/05/2000	milind		Added a barebones charm kernel scheduling 
				overhead measurement program.
09/15/2000	milind		Added pup support for AMPI and FEM framework.
09/20/2000	olawlor		Added capability to have an array of base type 
				where individual element could be of derived 
				types.
10/03/2000	gzheng		New supported platform: net-linux-axp
10/05/2000	skumar2		Added program littleMD to the test suite.
10/07/2000	skumar2		New job scheduler (Faucets projects).
10/15/2000	milind		Improved support for Fortran90 in charmc.
11/04/2000	jdesouza	Made the Faucets scheduler multi-threaded.
11/05/2000	olawlor		FEM Framework: supports multiple element types,
				mesh re-assembly, etc.
11/15/2000	gzheng		New platform support: net-cygwin
11/18/2000	gzheng		conv-host no longer needs /bin/csh to start 
				remote program.  set 
				CMK_CONV_HOST_CSH_UNAVAILABLE to 1 to use 
				/bin/sh instead.
11/25/2000	milind		Finished experimental implementation of 
				converse-threads based on co-operative pthreads.
11/25/2000	milind		Added a benchmark suite of all pingpongs in
				Charm++.
11/28/2000	milind		Removed deletion of _idx at the end of every 
				send or doneInserting call.  Instead now it is 
				in the destructor of the proxy. This allows us 
				to cache proxies, when proxy creation becomes 
				a bottleneck.
11/28/2000	olawlor		Added "seek blocks" to puppers.  This should 
				allow out-of-order pup'ing without the ugliness
				of getBuf; and in a way that works with all 
				PUP::ers.
11/29/2000	olawlor		Simplified and regularized command-line-argument
				handling.
11/29/2000	milind		AMPI: Added multiple-communicators capability.
12/05/2000	gzheng		Now /bin/sh is default shell to fork node 
				program on remote machines.
12/13/2000	olawlor		Added charmrun wrapper for poe on mpi-sp.
12/14/2000	milind		Added bluegene emulator sources and test 
				programs.  Added "bluegene" as a language known
				to charmc.  Makefile now has a target called 
				bluegene.  Added preliminary bluegene 
				documentation.  (copied from Arun's webpage.)
12/15/2000	gzheng		f90charm addition to Makefile and charmc. Also,
				added fixed size arrays support to f90charm. A 
				test program f90charm/hello is checked in.
12/17/2000	milind		Added rtest test program. Contributed by jim to
				test Converse message transmission.
12/20/2000	olawlor		Added charmconfig script. Enables automatic 
				determination of C++ compiler properties, 
				replacing the verbose and error-prone 
				conv-mach.h entries for CMK_BOOL, 
				CMK_STL_USE_DOT_H, CMK_CPP_CAST_OK, ...
12/20/2000	olawlor		Charm++ Arrays optimizations: Key and object 
				now variable-length fields, instead of pointers.
				This extra flexibility lets us save many 
				dynamic allocations in the array framework.
12/20/2000	olawlor		Added PUP::able support-- dynamic type 
				identification, allocation, and deletion.  
				Allows you to write:   p(objPtr); and 
				objPointer will be properly identified, 
				allocated, packed, and deallocated (depending 
				on the PUP::er).  Requires you to register any 
				such classes with DECLARE_PUPable and 
				DEFINE_PUPable.
12/20/2000	olawlor		Arrays optimizations: Made CkArrayIndex 
				fixed-size.  This significantly improves 
				messaging speed (7 us instead of 10 us 
				roundtrip).  Move spring cleaning check into a 
				CcdCallFnAfter, which gains more speed (down to
				4 us roundtrip).
12/20/2000	olawlor		More optimizations: Minor speed tweaks-- 
				conv-ccs.c uses hashtable for handler lookup; 
				conv-conds skips timer test until needed; 
				convcore.c scheduler loop optmizations (no 
				superfluous EndIdle calls); threads.c 
				CMK_OPTIMIZE-> no mprotect.
12/20/2000	olawlor		More Optimizations: Minor speed tweaks-- ck.C 
				groups cldEnqueue skip; init.h defines 
				CkLocalBranch inline; and supporting changes.
12/22/2000	gzheng		IA64 support for Converse user level threads.
01/02/2001	olawlor		CCS: Minor update-- enabled CcsProbe, cleaned 
				up superflous debug messages in server, added 
				Java interface (originally written for 
				AppSpecter).
01/09/2001	gzheng		charmconfig converted to autoconf style, need 
				to change configure.in and conv-autoconfig.h.in,
				and run autoconf to get configure and copy to 
				charmconfig.  added fortran subroutine name 
				test and get libpthread.a
01/10/2001	milind		Added telnet method of getting libpthread.a 
				from charm webserver.
01/11/2001	olawlor		Moved projections files here from 
				CVSROOT/projections-java.  Added fast Java 
				versions of the .log file input routines in 
				LogReader, LogLoader, LogAnalyzer, and 
				UsageCalc.  Added "U.java" user interface 
				utility file, allowing times to be input in 
				seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds, 
				instead of just microseconds.
01/15/2001	gzheng		add +trace-root to specify the directory to 
				put log files in. this is need in Scyld cluster
				where there is no NFS mounting and no i/o 
				access to home directory sharing on nodes.
01/15/2001	milind		Made AMPI into a f90 module instead of 
				'ampif.h' inclusion.  AMPI f90 bindings are 
				now more inclusive.  Fixed argc,argv handling 
				bugs in ArgsInfo message.  Fixed a bug in pup 
				that caused thread not to be sized, but was 
				packed nevertheless. Moved irecv to waitall 
				instead of at in ampi_start.  Made 
				AMPI_COMM_WORLD to be 0, because it clashed 
				with wildcard(-1).  AMPI_COMM_UNIVERSE is now 
				handled properly in the AMPI module.  
				C/C++ data members are NOT visible to 
				Fortran 90.
01/18/2001	gzheng		New supported platform: net-linux-scyld
01/20/2001	olawlor		Moved array index field from CMessage_* to the 
				Ck envelope itself.  This is the right thing 
				to do, because any message may be sent to/from 
				an array element.  To reduce the wasted space 
				in a message, a union is used to overlay the 
				fields for the various possible message types.
01/29/2001	olawlor		Freed charmrun on net-* version from using
				remote shell to fork off processes. One can now
				use a daemon provided in the distribution.
02/07/2001	olawlor		Added debugging support to puppers.
02/13/2000	gzheng		Added ++local option to charmrun to start node 
				program locally without any daemon; fix the 
				hang program if you type wrong pgm name in 
				scyld version, and redirect all output to 
				/dev/null, otherwise all node program can send 
				its output to console in scyld. Also implemented				++local in net-win32 version.
02/26/2000	milind		Changed the varsize syntax. Now one can specify
				actual varsize arrays in the interface file
				and have the translator generate alloc, pack 
				and unpack.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

06/20/2000	milind		mpi-* versions: Fixed ConverseExit since it was
				not obeying the following statement in the MPI 
				standard: The user must ensure that all pending
				communications involving a process completes 
				before the process calls MPI_FINALIZE.
07/05/2000	milind		Fixed a nasty bug in charmc in the -cp option. 
				It used to append the name provided to -o flag 
				to the directory provided to the -cp flag.  
				Thus, -o ../pgm -cp ../bin options meant that 
				the pgm would be copied to ../bin/.., which is 
				not the expected behavior. This fix correctly 
				copies pgm to ../bin.
07/07/2000	milind		Removed variable arg_myhome, as it was not 
				being used anywhere, and also, setting it was 
				causing problems of env var HOME was not set.
07/27/2000	milind		thishandle for the arrayelement was not being 
				correctly set.  Bug was reported by Neelam.
08/26/2000	milind		Origin2000: Changed the page alignment to 
				reflect the mmap alignment.  The mmap man page 
				specifically states that it is not the same as 
				page size.
09/02/2000	milind		Fixed a bug in code generated for threaded 
				(void) entry methods of array elements. The 
				dummy message that is passed to that method in 
				a thread has to be deleted before calling the 
				object method, because upon object method's 
				return, the thread might have migrated.
09/03/2000	olawlor		Minor fix-fixes: 1.) Change to LBObjid hash 
				function would fail for >4-int object indices.
				Replaced with proper function, which also 
				preserves the 1-int case.  2.) Array element 
				sends must go via the message queue to prevent 
				stack build-up for deep single-processor call 
				chains. These might happen, e.g., in a driver 
				element calling itself for the main time loop.
				Messages are now properly noted as sent, then 
				wait through the queue for delivery.  This 
				entailed minor reorganization of the message 
				delivery subsystem.
09/21/2000	olawlor		Tiny SMP thread fix-- registrations of a 
				thread-private variable now reserve space on 
				calls after the first.  This wastes space for 
				multiple CthInitialize's-- it's a quick hack to
				get threads working again on SMP versions.
10/16/2000	olawlor		A few CCS fixes:   -Added split-phase reply 
				(delay reply indefinitely)  -Cleaned up error
				handling -Pass user data as "void *" instead of
				"char *"
11/03/2000	wilmarth	Removed 0 size array allocation in Charm++ 
				quiescence detection.
11/20/2000	gzheng		Rewrote part of Fiber thread, including a bug 
				fix for a the non thread-safe function, and a 
				different fiber free strategy.
11/29/2000	gzheng		The LB init procedure tried to allocate 
				65536*160 as initial size, which is 10M memory 
				for communication table, which is too big. 
				Cut it down to roughly 1M, and it can expand 
				in later code.
12/05/2000	gzheng		In many cases, conv-host exits without print 
				out the error message from remote shell. try 
				to fix it by calling sync to flush the pipe 
				before exit 1.
12/10/2000	milind		net-linux: Made static linking the default 
				option because dynamic linking runtime causes 
				isomalloc threads to crash.
12/18/2000	milind		Increased portability of isomalloc threads by 
				removing dependence on alloca.
12/28/2000	milind		Fixed ctrl-getone abort bug on SMP.
12/28/2000	milind		Made _groupTable a pointer on which a 
				constructor is explicitly called.  Since it 
				was a Cpv variable, its constructor was not 
				called by default in case of an SMP version.
12/29/2000	olawlor		Prevent infinite copy constructor recursion on 
				Origin2000.
01/10/2001	olawlor		Added "explicit" keyword to remove ambiguity 
				for KCC, which was confused by the private 
				PUP::er(int) "cast" constructor and the operator
				|(PUP::er &p,T &t) into rejecting all operator|
				(int,int) as ambiguous.
2001/01/17	gzheng		fix the charmconfig bug on paragon-red: the 
				failure testing of fortran won't stop the 
				compilation.
01/20/2001	olawlor		Arrays reduction:  Fixed bug-- reduction may end
				because all contributors migrate away. 
01/29/2001	olawlor		Fix heap-corrupting bug-- call ->init() on 
				nodeGroupTable, which sets the "pending" 
				message queue to NULL.  This prevents a nasty 
				delete-unitialized-data bug later on.  Also 
				delayed queue creation until messages actually 
				arrive.

				quantum TA
02/28/2000	wilmarth	Added a new look Charm++ manual.
06/20/2000	milind		Added pdflatex support to generate PDF versions
				of manuals from LaTeX sources.
12/05/2000	milind		Added Orion's FEM manual. Converted from HTML.

Other Changes:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10/24/1999	olawlor		charmc is changed to Bourne shell script 
				instead of csh. All conv-mach.csh are
				replaced by conv-mach.sh.
10/25/1999	olawlor		SUPER_INSTALL is converted to use bourne shell.
10/28/1999	milind		All Makefiles now take OPTS commandline
				arguments.
01/16/2000	olawlor		Simplified Charm++ interface translator.
02/23/2000	ruiliu		Changed rand() calls from all over the codes
				to the new Converse random number generator.
02/26/2000	milind		Simplified the converse scheduler loop by 
				combining the maxmsgs and poll modes.
08/31/2000	milind		Imported system documentation into the CVS tree.
				Also added super_install target for docs with 
				necessary Makefile modifications.
09/08/2000	olawlor		Made soft links use relative pathnames instead 
				of absolute.  This lets you move a charm++ 
				installation without having to recompile 
				anything.
09/11/2000	olawlor		Grouped commonly needed code in the new util
				directory. Also, added pup_c a C wrapper for
				puppers.
09/11/2000	olawlor		Slightly reorganized header structure.  Now no 
				headers should need to be listed twice (once in
				ALLHEADERS, again in CKHEADERS).  Now headers 
				are soft-linked instead of copied.  This makes 
				development much easier.  Added support for the
				new Common/util directory.
09/21/2000	olawlor		Major reorganization of net-* codes. Now all 
				the TCP socket routines are in separate files.
				Also combined windoes NT code with unix codes.
09/21/2000	olawlor		Major rewrite of CCS-- underlying protocol is 
				now binary (send/recv binary data everywhere); 
				conv-host forwards requests to nodes; and 
				source has been significantly re-arranged.  
				(especially if NODE_0_IS_CONVHOST).
11/22/2000	milind		Removed IDL translator from distribution.
12/01/2000	olawlor		Renamed conv-host charmrun; added test for 
				script conv-host. Also added charmrun for most 
				other machines.
12/17/2000	milind		Moved List related data structures into 
				cklists.h in util. Removed most of the redundant
				list implementations.
12/20/2000	gzheng		SUPER_INSTALL: format the output of list of 
				versions and make the help page fit into one 
				page of xterm.
12/24/2000	milind		Added test-{charm,converse,ampi,fem} targets to 
				super_install.
12/28/2000	milind		net-sol-smp now uses pthreads.
01/29/2001	olawlor		Merged windowsNT and unix build procedures by
				basing the Windows build on cygwin. Added 
				scripts to deal with unix and windows 
				differences.
