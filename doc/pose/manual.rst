Introduction
============

POSE (Parallel Object-oriented Simulation Environment) is a tool for
parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) based on Charm++. You should
have a background in object-oriented programming (preferably C++) and
know the basic principles behind discrete event simulation. Familiarity
with simple parallel programming in Charm++ is also a plus.

POSE uses the approach of message-driven execution of Charm++, but adds
the element of discrete timestamps to control when, in simulated time, a
message is executed.

Users may choose synchronization strategies (conservative or several
optimistic variants) on a per class basis, depending on the desired
behavior of the object. However, POSE is intended to perform best with a
special type of *adaptive* synchronization strategy which changes it’s
behavior on a per object basis. Thus, other synchronization strategies
may not be properly maintained. There are two significant versions of
the adaptive strategy, *adapt4*, a simple, stable version, and *adept*, the
development version.

Developing a model in POSE
--------------------------

Modeling a system in POSE is similar to how you would model in C++ or
any OOP language. Objects are entities that hold data, and have a fixed
set of operations that can be performed on them (methods).

Charm++ provides the parallelism we desire, but the model does not
differ dramatically from C++. The primary difference is that objects may
exist on a set of processors, and so invoking methods on them requires
communication via messages. These parallel objects are called *chares*.

POSE adds to Charm++ by putting timestamps on method invocations
(events), and executing events in timestamp order to preserve the
validity of the global state.

Developing a model in POSE involves identifying the entities we wish to
model, determining their interactions with other entities and
determining how they change over time.

PDES in POSE
------------

A simulation in POSE consists of a set of Charm++ chares performing
timestamped events in parallel. In POSE, these chares are called *posers*.
POSE is designed to work with many such entities per processor. The more
a system can be broken down into its parallel components when designing
the simulation model, the more potential parallelism in the final
application.

A poser class is defined with a synchronization strategy associated with
it. We encourage the use of the adaptive strategies, as mentioned
earlier. Adaptive strategies are optimistic, and will potentially
execute events out of order, but have rollback and cancellation messages
as well as checkpointing abilities to deal with this behind the scenes.

Execution is driven by events. An event arrives for a poser and is
sorted into a queue by timestamp. The poser has a local time called
object virtual time (OVT) which represents its progress through the
simulation. When an event arrives with a timestamp :math:`t>`\ OVT, the
OVT is advanced to :math:`t`. If the event has timestamp
:math:`t<`\ OVT, it may be that other events with greater timestamps
were executed. If this is the case, a rollback will occur. If not, the
event is simply executed along with the others in the queue.

Time can also pass on a poser within the course of executing an event.
An *elapse* function is used to advance the OVT.

POSE maintains a global clock, the global virtual time (GVT), that
represents the progress of the entire simulation.

Currently, POSE has no way to directly specify event dependencies, so if
they exist, the programmer must handle errors in ordering carefully.
POSE provides a delayed error message print and abort function that is
only performed if there is no chance of rolling back the dependency
error. Another mechanism provided by POSE is a method of tagging events
with *sequence numbers*. This allows the user to determine the execution
order of events which have the same timestamp.

Compiling, Running and Debugging a Sample POSE program
======================================================

Sample code is available in the Charm++ source distribution. Assuming a
netlrts-linux build of Charm++, look in
``charm/netlrts-linux/examples/pose``. The SimBenchmark directory
contains a synthetic benchmark simulation and is fairly straightforward
to understand.

Compiling
---------

To build a POSE simulation, run ``etrans.pl`` on each POSE module to get
the new source files. etrans.pl is a source to source translator. Given
a module name it will translate the ``module.h``, ``module.ci``, and
``module.C`` files into ``module_sim.h``, ``module_sim.ci``, and
``module_sim.C`` files. The translation operation adds wrapper classes
for POSE objects and handles the interface with strategies and other
poser options.

To facilitate code organization, the ``module.C`` file can be broken up
into multiple files and those files can appended to the etrans.pl
command line after the module name. These additional .C files will be
translated and their output appended to the ``module_sim.C`` file.

The ``-s`` switch can be passed to use the sequential simulator feature
of POSE on your simulation, but you must also build a sequential version
when you compile (see below).

Once the code has been translated, it is a Charm++ program that can be
compiled with ``charmc``. Please refer to the CHARM++/CONVERSE
Installation and Usage Manual for details on the charmc command. You
should build the new source files produced by etrans.pl along with the
main program and any other source needed with ``charmc``, linking with
``-module pose`` (or ``-module seqpose`` for a sequential version) and
``-language charm++``. The SimBenchmark example has a Makefile that
shows this process.

Running
-------

To run the program in parallel, a ``charmrun`` executable was created by
``charmc``. The flag ``+p`` is used to specify a number of processors to
run the program on. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ./charmrun pgm +p4

This runs the executable ``pgm`` on 4 processors. For more information
on how to use ``charmrun`` and set up your environment for parallel
runs, see the CHARM++/CONVERSE Installation and Usage Manual.

Debugging
---------

Because POSE is translated to Charm++, debugging is a little more
challenging than normal. Multi-processor debugging can be achieved with
the ``charmrun ++debug`` option, and debugging is performed on the
``module_sim.C`` source files. The user thus has to track down problems
in the original POSE source code. A long-term goal of the POSE
developers is to eliminate the translation phase and rely on the
interface translator of Charm++ to provide similar functionality.

Sequential Mode
---------------

As mentioned above, the same source code can be used to generate a
purely sequential POSE executable by using the ``-s`` flag to
``etrans.pl`` and linking with ``-module seqpose``. This turns off all
aspects of synchronization, checkpointing and GVT calculation that are
needed for optimistic parallel execution. Thus you should experience
better one-processor times for executables built for sequential
execution than those built for parallel execution. This is convenient
for examining how a program scales in comparison to sequential time. It
is also helpful for simulations that are small and fast, or in
situations where multiple processors are not available.

Programming in POSE
===================

This section details syntax and usage of POSE constructs with code
samples.

POSE Modules
------------

A POSE module is similar to a Charm++ module. It is comprised of an
interface file with suffix ``.ci``, a header ``.h`` file, and the
implementation in ``.C`` files. Several posers can be described in one
module, and the module can include regular chares as well. The module is
translated into Charm++ before the simulation can be compiled. This
translation is performed by a Perl script called ``etrans.pl`` which is
included with POSE. It generates files suffixed ``_sim.ci``, ``_sim.h``,
and ``_sim.C``.

Event Message and Poser Interface Description
---------------------------------------------

Messages, be they event messages or otherwise, are described in the
``.ci`` file exactly the way they are in Charm++. Event messages cannot
make use of Charm++’s parameter marshalling, and thus you must declare
them in the ``.h`` file. Charm++ ``varsize`` event messages are
currently not implemented in POSE.

All event messages inherit from a POSE type ``eventMsg`` which includes
data for timestamps and miscellaneous POSE statistics.

A message is declared in the ``.ci`` file as follows:

.. code-block:: none

  message myMessage;


Posers are described similar to chares, with a few exceptions. First,
the ``poser`` keyword is used to denote that the class is a POSE
simulation object class. Second, event methods are tagged with the
keyword ``event`` in square brackets. Finally, three components are
specified which indicate how objects of the poser class are to be
simulated. The *sim* component controls the wrapper class and event
queue used by the object. The *strat* component controls the
synchronization strategy the object should use (*i.e.* adaptive or
basic optimistic). The *rep* component specifies the global state
representation, which controls how the global state is kept accurate
depending on the synchronization strategy being used (*i.e.*
checkpointing or no checkpointing). Currently, there is only one
wrapper type, ``sim``. This 3-tuple syntax is likely to become
obsolete, replaced simply by synchronization strategy only. Keeping
the global state accurate is largely a function of the synchronization
strategy used.

.. code-block:: none

  poser mySim : sim strat rep {
    entry mySim(myMessage *);``
    entry [event] void myEventMethod(eventMsg *);
    ...
  };

A typical ``.ci`` file poser specification might look like this:

.. code-block:: none

  poser Worker : sim adapt4 chpt {
    entry Worker(WorkerCreationMsg *);
    entry [event] void doWork(WorkMsg *);
    ...
  };

Note that the constructors and event methods of a poser must take an
event message as parameter. If there is no data (and thereby no
message defined) that needs to be passed to the method, then the
parameter should be of type ``eventMsg *``. This ensures that POSE
will be able to timestamp the event.

Declaring Event Messages and Posers
-----------------------------------

Currently, event messages are declared with no reference to what they
might inherit from (unlike in Charm++). The translator takes care of
this. In addition, they must define ``operator=``.

::

  class myMessage {
    public:
    int someData;
    myMessage& operator=(const myMessage& obj) {
      eventMsg::operator=(obj);
      someData = obj.someData;
      return *this;
    }
  };

Similarly, posers do not refer to a base class when they are declared.
Posers are required to have a void constructor declared that simply
initializes the data to sensible values. A destructor must be provided
as well. In addition, a ``pup`` and ``operator=`` must be provided.
The ``pup`` method should call the ``pup`` method of the global state
representation class being used.

::

  class mySim {
    int anInt; float aFloat; char aString[20];
     public:
    mySim();
    mySim(myMessage *m);
    ~mySim();
    void pup(PUP::er &p);
    mySim& operator=(const mySim& obj);
    void myEventMethod(eventMsg *m);
    void myEventMethod_anti(eventMsg *m);
    void myEventMethod_commit(eventMsg *m);
    ...
  };

Further, for each event method, a commit method should be declared,
and if the synchronization strategy being used is optimistic or
involves any sort of rollback, an anti-method should also be provided.
The syntax of these declarations is shown above. Their usage and
implementation will be described next.

Implementing Posers
-------------------

The void constructor for a poser should be defined however the user sees
fit. It could be given an empty body and should still work for POSE.
Poser entry constructors (those described in the ``.ci`` file) should
follow the template below:

::

  mySim::mySim(myMessage *m)
  {
    // initializations from $m$
    ...
    delete m;
    ...
  };


Note that while the incoming message :math:`m` may be deleted here in
the constructor, event messages received on event methods should
**not** be deleted. The PDES fossil collection will take care of
those.

An event method should have the following form:

::

  void mySim::myEventMethod(eventMsg *m) {
    // body of method
  };


Again, :math:`m` is never deleted in the body of the event. A side
effect of optimistic synchronization and rollback is that we would
like the effects of event execution to be dependent only upon the
state encapsulated in the corresponding poser. Thus, accessing
arbitrary states outside of the simulation, such as by calling
``rand``, is forbidden. We are planning to fix this problem by adding
a ``POSE_rand()`` operation which will generate a random number the
first time the event is executed, and will checkpoint the number for
use in subsequent re-executions should a rollback occur.

Creation of Poser Objects
-------------------------

Posers are created within a module using the following syntax:

::

  int hdl = 13; // handle should be unique
  myMessage *m = new myMessage;
  m->someData = 34;
  POSE_create(mySim(m), hdl, 0);

This creates a ``mySim`` object that comes into existence at
simulation time zero, and can be referred to by the handle 13.

Creating a poser from outside the module (*i.e.* from ``main``) is
somewhat more complex:

::

  int hdl = 13;
  myMessage *m = new myMessage;
  m->someData = 34;
  m->Timestamp(0);
  (*(CProxy_mySim *) & POSE_Objects)[hdl].insert(m);

This is similar to what the module code ultimately gets translated to
and should be replaced by a macro with similar syntax soon.

Event Method Invocations
------------------------

Event method invocations vary significantly from entry method
invocations in Charm++, and various forms should be used depending on
where the event method is being invoked. In addition, event messages
sent to an event method should be allocated specifically for an event
invocation, and cannot be recycled or deleted.

There are three ways to send events within a POSE module. The first and
most commonly used way involves specifying and offset in simulation time
from the current time. The syntax follows:

::

  aMsg = new eventMsg;
  POSE_invoke(myEventMethod(aMsg), mySim, hdl, 0);

Here, we’ve created an ``eventMsg`` and sent it to ``myEventMethod``,
an event entry point on ``mySim``. ``mySim`` was created at handle
``hdl``, and we want the event to take place now, i.e. at the current
simulation time, so the offset is zero.

The second way to send an event is reserved for use by non-poser objects
within the module. It should not be used by posers. This version allows
you to specify an absolute simulation time at which the event happens
(as opposed to an offset to the current time). Since non-poser objects
are not a part of the simulation, they do not have a current time, or
OVT, by which to specify an offset. The syntax is nearly identical to
that above, only the last parameter is an absolute time.

::

  aMsg = new eventMsg;
  POSE_invoke_at(myEventMethod(aMsg), mySim, hdl, 56);


Posers should not use this approach because of the risk of specifying
an absolute time that is earlier than the current time on the object
sending the event.

Using this method, event methods can be injected into the system from
outside any module, but this is not recommended.

The third approach is useful when an object send events to itself. It is
simply a slightly shorter syntax for the same thing as ``POSE_invoke``:

::

  aMsg = new eventMsg;
  POSE_local_invoke(myEventMethod(aMsg), offset);

Elapsing Simulation Time
------------------------

We’ve seen in the previous section how it is possible to advance
simulation time by generating events with non-zero offsets of current
time. When such events are received on an object, if the object is
behind, it advances its local simulation time (object virtual time or
OVT) to the timestamp of the event.

It is also possible to elapse time on an object while the object is
executing an event. This is accomplished thus:

::

 elapse(42);


The example above would simulate the passage of forty-two time units
by adding as much to the object’s current OVT.

Interacting with a POSE Module and the POSE System
--------------------------------------------------

POSE modules consist of ``<modname>.ci``, ``<modname>.h`` and
``<modname>.C`` files that are translated via ``etrans.pl`` into
``<modname>_sim.ci``, ``<modname>_sim.h`` and ``<modname>_sim.C`` files.
To interface these with a main program module, say :math:`Pgm` in files
``pgm.ci``, ``pgm.h`` and ``pgm.C``, the ``pgm.ci`` file must declare
the POSE module as extern in the ``mainmodule Pgm`` block. For example:

::

  mainmodule Pgm {
    extern module <modname>;
    readonly CkChareID mainhandle;

    mainchare main {
      entry main();
    };
  };

The ``pgm.C`` file should include ``pose.h`` and ``<modname>_sim.h``
along with its own headers, declarations and whatever else it needs.

Somewhere in the ``main`` function, ``POSE_init()`` should be called.
This initializes all of POSE’s internal data structures. The parameters
to ``POSE_init()`` specify a termination method. POSE programs can be
terminated in two ways: with inactivity detection or with an end time.
Inactivity detection terminates after a few iterations of the GVT if no
events are being executed and virtual time is not advancing. When an end
time is specified, and the GVT passes it, the simulation exits. If no
parameters are provided to ``POSE_init()``, then the simulation will use
inactivity detection. If a time is provided as the parameter, this time
will be used as the end time.

Now POSE is ready for posers. All posers can be created at this point,
each with a unique handle. The programmer is responsible for choosing
and keeping track of the handles created for posers. Once all posers are
created, the simulation can be started:

::

  POSE_start();


Configuring POSE
================

POSE can be configured in two different ways. Fundamental behaviors are
controlled by altering values in the ``pose_config.h`` file in the POSE
installation, and rebuilding POSE. Many of these configuration options
can (and should) be controlled by command line options. These will be
designated here by an asterisk (:math:`*`). See
section :numref:`sec:posecommand` for the command line options.

-  | ``POSE_STATS_ON *``
   | :math:`\circ` Turn on timing and statistics gathering for internal
     POSE operations. Produces a small slowdown in program.

-  | ``POSE_DOP_ON *``
   | :math:`\circ` Turn on timing and statistics gathering for degree of
     parallelism calculations. Generates log files that can be loaded by
     ploticus scripts to produce graphs plotting active entities over
     time. Slows down program dramatically.

-  | ``POSE_COMM_ON``
   | :math:`\circ` Turn on streaming communication optimization for
     small message packing.

-  | ``COMM_TIMEOUT``
   | :math:`\circ` Used by streaming communication library. Time to wait
     (in ?) before sending buffered messages.

-  | ``COMM_MAXMSG``
   | :math:`\circ` Used by streaming communication library. Number of
     messages to buffer before packing and sending as one.

-  | ``LB_ON *``
   | :math:`\circ` Turn on POSE load balancing.

-  | ``STORE_RATE *``
   | :math:`\circ` Default checkpointing rate: 1 for every
     ``STORE_RATE`` events.

-  | ``SPEC_WINDOW *``
   | :math:`\circ` Speculative window size: this is how far (in virtual
     time units) ahead of GVT posers are allowed to go.

-  | ``MIN_LEASH *`` and ``MAX_LEASH *``
   | :math:`\circ` Bounds on the speculative window, these are adjusted
     by adaptive synchronization strategies.

-  | ``LEASH_FLEX *``
   | :math:`\circ` Granularity of flexibility when speculative window is
     shrunk or expanded.

-  | ``MAX_POOL_SIZE``
   | :math:`\circ` Memory used by event messages is recycled. This
     controls how many messages of a particular size will be kept on
     hand.

-  | ``MAX_RECYCLABLE``
   | :math:`\circ` This is the largest size of message that will be
     recycled.

-  | ``LB_SKIP *``
   | :math:`\circ` This controls the frequency of load balance
     invocation. 1 in every ``LB_SKIP`` executions of the GVT algorithm
     will invoke load balancing.

-  | ``LB_THRESHOLD *``
   | :math:`\circ` What the heck does this number mean? I can’t
     remember. I’ll have to look through the code... later. Meanwhile, I
     think this indicates some sort of threshold a single processor has
     to cross before we even bother with analyzing the load.

-  | ``LB_DIFF *``
   | :math:`\circ` Once the load has been analyzed, we compute the
     difference between the max and min PE loads. Only if this
     difference exceeds ``LB_DIFF`` do we bother migrating posers.

Several of the above flags and constants will be eliminated as the
adaptive strategy is expanded. What remains will eventually become
run-time options.

.. _sec:posecommand:

POSE Command Line Options
-------------------------

Command line options are handled like Charm++ command line parameters.
For namespace purity all POSE command line options have a \_pose suffix.
They can be inspected by appending a ``-h`` to an execution of a POSE
program. Command line options override any defaults set in the
``pose_config.h`` file

-  | ``+stats_pose``
   | :math:`\circ` Turn on timing and statistics gathering for internal
     POSE operations. Produces a small slowdown in program.

-  | ``+dop_pose``
   | :math:`\circ` Turn on timing and statistics gathering for degree of
     parallelism calculations. Generates log files that can be loaded by
     ploticus scripts to produce graphs plotting active entities over
     time. Slows down program dramatically.

-  | ``+lb_on_pose``
   | :math:`\circ` Turn on POSE load balancing.

-  | ``+store_rate_pose N``
   | :math:`\circ` Default checkpointing rate: 1 for every
     ``STORE_RATE`` events.

-  | ``+spec_window_pose N``
   | :math:`\circ` Speculative window size: this is how far (in virtual
     time units) ahead of GVT posers are allowed to go.

-  | ``+min_leash_pose N`` and ``+min_leash_pose N``
   | :math:`\circ` Bounds on the speculative window, these are adjusted
     by adaptive synchronization strategies.

-  | ``+leash_flex_pose N``
   | :math:`\circ` Granularity of flexibility when speculative window is
     shrunk or expanded.

-  | ``+lb_skip_pose N``
   | :math:`\circ` This controls the frequency of load balance
     invocation. 1 in every ``LB_SKIP`` executions of the GVT algorithm
     will invoke load balancing.

-  | ``+lb_threshold_pose N``
   | :math:`\circ` Minimum threshold for load balancing, default is 4000

-  | ``+lb_diff_pose N``
   | :math:`\circ` Once the load has been analyzed, we compute the
     difference between the max and min PE loads. Only if this
     difference exceeds ``LB_DIFF`` do we bother migrating posers.

-  | ``+checkpoint_gvt_pose N``
   | :math:`\circ` Checkpoint to disk approximately every N GVT ticks (N
     is an integer). The default is 0, which indicates no checkpointing.

-  | ``+checkpoint_time_pose N``
   | :math:`\circ` Checkpoint to disk every N seconds (N is an integer).
     The default is 0, which indicates no checkpointing. If both this
     parameter and +checkpoint_gvt_pose are greater than 0, a warning
     will be given, the value of this parameter will be set to 0, and
     POSE will checkpoint based on GVT ticks.

As a technical point, pose command line parsing is done inside the
``POSE_init()`` call. Therefore, the most consistent behavior for
interleaving pose command line options with user application options
will be achieved by calling ``POSE_init()`` before handling user
application command line arguments.

Glossary of POSE-specific Terms
===============================

-  | ``void POSE_init()``
   | :math:`\circ` Initializes various items in POSE; creates the load
     balancer if load balancing is turned on; initializes the statistics
     gathering facility if statistics are turned on.
   | :math:`\circ` Must be called in user’s main program prior to
     creation of any simulation objects or reference to any other POSE
     construct.

   | :math:`\circ` Registers callback function with POSE - when program
     ends or quiesces, function is called.
   | :math:`\circ` CkCallback is created with the index of the callback
     function and a proxy to the object that function is to be called
     on. For example, to register the function ``wrapUp`` in the main
     module as a callback:

   ::

        CProxy_main M(mainhandle);
        POSE_registerCallBack(CkCallback(CkIndex_main::wrapUp(), M));

   | :math:`\circ` Similar to ``CkExit()``.

   | :math:`\circ` Send a *methodName* event with message :math:`m` to
     this object at current OVT + :math:`timeOffset`.
   | :math:`\circ` This is used by poser objects to send events to
     themselves.
