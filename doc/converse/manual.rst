Initialization and Completion
=============================

The program utilizing Converse begins executing at ``main``, like any
other C program. The initialization process is somewhat complicated by
the fact that hardware vendors don’t agree about which processors should
execute ``main``. On some machines, every processor executes ``main``.
On others, only one processor executes ``main``. All processors which
don’t execute ``main`` are asleep when the program begins. The function
``ConverseInit`` is used to start the Converse system, and to wake up the
sleeping processors.

.. code-block:: c++

   typedef void (*CmiStartFn)(int argc, char **argv);
   void ConverseInit(int argc, char *argv[], CmiStartFn fn, int usched, int
   initret);

This function starts up the Converse system. It can execute in one of
the modes described below.

Normal Mode: ``schedmode=0, initret=0``

When the user runs a program, some of the processors automatically
invoke ``main``, while others remain asleep. All processors which
automatically invoked ``main`` must call ``ConverseInit``. This initializes
the entire Converse system. Converse then initiates, on *all*
processors, the execution of the user-supplied start-function
``fn(argc, argv)``. When this function returns, Converse automatically
calls ``CsdScheduler``, a function that polls for messages and executes
their handlers (see chapter 2). Once ``CsdScheduler`` exits on all
processors, the Converse system shuts down, and the user’s program
terminates. Note that in this case, ``ConverseInit`` never returns. The user
is not allowed to poll for messages manually.

User-calls-scheduler Mode: ``schedmode=1, initret=0``

If the user wants to poll for messages and other events manually, this
mode is used to initialize Converse. In normal mode, it is assumed that
the user-supplied start-function ``fn(argc, argv)`` is just for
initialization, and that the remainder of the lifespan of the program is
spent in the (automatically-invoked) function ``CsdScheduler``, polling
for messages. In user-calls-scheduler mode, however, it is assumed that
the user-supplied start-function will perform the *entire computation*,
including polling for messages. Thus, ``ConverseInit`` will not
automatically call ``CsdScheduler`` for you. When the user-supplied
start-function ends, Converse shuts down. This mode is not supported on
the sim version. This mode can be combined with ConverseInit-returns
mode below.

ConverseInit-returns Mode: ``schedmode=1, initret=1``

This option is used when you want ``ConverseInit`` to return. All processors
which automatically invoked ``main`` must call ``ConverseInit``. This
initializes the entire Converse System. On all processors which *did
not* automatically invoke ``main``, Converse initiates the user-supplied
initialization function ``fn(argc, argv)``. Meanwhile, on those
processors which *did* automatically invoke ``main``, ``ConverseInit``
returns. Shutdown is initiated when the processors that *did*
automatically invoke ``main`` call ConverseExit, and when the other
processors return from ``fn``. The optional exit code is returned to the
calling shell. If no value is specified, an exit code of zero is
returned. In this mode, all polling for messages must be done manually
(probably using CsdScheduler explicitly). This option is not supported
by the sim version.

.. code-block:: c++

  void ConverseExit(int exitcode /*optional*/)

This function is only used in ConverseInit-returns mode, described
above.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiAbort(char *msg, ...)

This function can be used portably to abnormally terminate a Converse
program. Before termination, it prints a message supplied as ``msg``.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiAssert(int expr)

This macro terminates the Converse program after printing an informative
message if ``expr`` evaluates to 0. It can be used in place of
``assert``. In order to turn off ``CmiAssert``, one should define
:math:`CMK\_OPTIMIZE` as 1.

Machine Interface and Scheduler
===============================

This chapter describes two of Converse’s modules: the CMI, and the CSD.
Together, they serve to transmit messages and schedule the delivery of
messages. First, we describe the machine model assumed by Converse.

.. _model:

Machine Model
-------------

Converse treats the parallel machine as a collection of *nodes*, where
each node is comprised of a number of *processors* that share memory In
some cases, the number of processors per node may be exactly one (e.g.
Distributed memory multicomputers such as IBM SP.) In addition, each of
the processors may have multiple *threads* running on them which share
code and data but have different stacks. Functions and macros are
provided for handling shared memory across processors and querying node
information. These are discussed in Section :numref:`globalvars`.

.. _handler1:

Defining Handler Numbers
------------------------

When a message arrives at a processor, it triggers the execution of a
*handler function*, not unlike a UNIX signal handler. The handler
function receives, as an argument, a pointer to the message. The message
itself specifies which handler function is to be called when the message
arrives. Messages are contiguous sequences of bytes. The message has two
parts: the header, and the data. The data may contain anything you like.
The header contains a *handler number*, which specifies which handler
function is to be executed when the message arrives. Before you can send
a message, you have to define the handler numbers.

Converse maintains a table mapping handler numbers to function pointers.
Each processor has its own copy of the mapping. There is a caution
associated with this approach: it is the user’s responsibility to ensure
that all processors have identical mappings. This is easy to do,
nonetheless, and the user must be aware that this is (usually) required.

The following functions are provided to define the handler numbers:

.. code-block:: c++

  typedef void (*CmiHandler)(void *)

Functions that handle Converse messages must be of this type.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CmiRegisterHandler(CmiHandler h)

This represents the standard technique for associating numbers with
functions. To use this technique, the Converse user registers each of
his functions, one by one, using CmiRegisterHandler. One must register
exactly the same functions in exactly the same order on all processors.
The system assigns monotonically increasing numbers to the functions,
the same numbers on all processors. This insures global consistency.
CmiRegisterHandler returns the number which was chosen for the function
being registered.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CmiRegisterHandlerGlobal(CmiHandler h)

This represents a second registration technique. The Converse user
registers his functions on processor zero, using
CmiRegisterHandlerGlobal. The Converse user is then responsible for
broadcasting those handler numbers to other processors, and installing
them using CmiNumberHandler below. The user should take care not to
invoke those handlers until they are fully installed.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CmiRegisterHandlerLocal(CmiHandler h)

This function is used when one wishes to register functions in a manner
that is not consistent across processors. This function chooses a
locally-meaningful number for the function, and records it locally. No
attempt is made to ensure consistency across processors.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiNumberHandler(int n, CmiHandler h)

Forces the system to associate the specified handler number n with the
specified handler function h. If the function number n was previously
mapped to some other function, that old mapping is forgotten. The
mapping that this function creates is local to the current processor.
CmiNumberHandler can be useful in combination with
CmiRegisterGlobalHandler. It can also be used to implement user-defined
numbering schemes: such schemes should keep in mind that the size of the
table that holds the mapping is proportional to the largest handler
number — do not use big numbers!

(**Note:** Of the three registration methods, the CmiRegisterHandler
method is by far the simplest, and is strongly encouraged. The others
are primarily to ease the porting of systems that already use similar
registration techniques. One may use all three registration methods in a
program. The system guarantees that no numbering conflicts will occur as
a result of this combination.)

.. _handler2:

Writing Handler Functions
-------------------------

A message handler function is just a C function that accepts a void
pointer (to a message buffer) as an argument, and returns nothing. The
handler may use the message buffer for any purpose, but is responsible
for eventually deleting the message using CmiFree.

Building Messages
-----------------

To send a message, one first creates a buffer to hold the message. The
buffer must be large enough to hold the header and the data. The buffer
can be in any kind of memory: it could be a local variable, it could be
a global, it could be allocated with ``malloc``, and finally, it could
be allocated with CmiAlloc. The Converse user fills the buffer with the
message data. One puts a handler number in the message, thereby
specifying which handler function the message should trigger when it
arrives. Finally, one uses a message-transmission function to send the
message.

The following functions are provided to help build message buffers:

.. code-block:: c++

  void *CmiAlloc(int size)

Allocates memory of size size in heap and returns pointer to the usable
space. There are some message-sending functions that accept only message
buffers that were allocated with CmiAlloc. Thus, this is the preferred
way to allocate message buffers. The returned pointer point to the
message header, the user data will follow it. See CmiMsgHeaderSizeBytes
for this.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiFree(void *ptr)

This function frees the memory pointed to by ptr. ptr should be a
pointer that was previously returned by CmiAlloc.

.. code-block:: c++

  #define CmiMsgHeaderSizeBytes

This constant contains the size of the message header. When one
allocates a message buffer, one must set aside enough space for the
header and the data. This macro helps you to do so. For example, if one
want to allocate an array of 100 int, he should call the function this
way:

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiSetHandler(int *MessageBuffer, int HandlerId)

This macro sets the handler number of a message to HandlerId.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CmiGetHandler(int *MessageBuffer)

This call returns the handler of a message in the form of a handler
number.

.. code-block:: c++

  CmiHandler CmiGetHandlerFunction(int *MessageBuffer)

This call returns the handler of a message in the form of a function
pointer.

Sending Messages
----------------

The following functions allow you to send messages. Our model is that
the data starts out in the message buffer, and from there gets
transferred “into the network”. The data stays “in the network” for a
while, and eventually appears on the target processor. Using that model,
each of these send-functions is a device that transfers data into the
network. None of these functions wait for the data to be delivered.

On some machines, the network accepts data rather slowly. We don’t want
the process to sit idle, waiting for the network to accept the data. So,
we provide several variations on each send function:

-  sync: a version that is as simple as possible, pushing the data into
   the network and not returning until the data is “in the network”. As
   soon as a sync function returns, you can reuse the message buffer.

-  async: a version that returns almost instantaneously, and then
   continues working in the background. The background job transfers the
   data from the message buffer into the network. Since the background
   job is still using the message buffer when the function returns, you
   can’t reuse the message buffer immediately. The background job sets a
   flag when it is done and you can then reuse the message buffer.

-  send and free: a version that returns almost instantaneously, and
   then continues working in the background. The background job
   transfers the data from the message buffer into the network. When the
   background job finishes, it CmiFrees the message buffer. In this
   situation, you can’t reuse the message buffer at all. To use a
   function of this type, you must allocate the message buffer using
   CmiAlloc.

-  node: a version that send a message to a node instead of a specific
   processor. This means that when the message is received, any “free”
   processor within than node can handle it.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiSyncSend(unsigned int destPE, unsigned int size, void *msg)

Sends msg of size size bytes to processor destPE. When it returns, you
may reuse the message buffer.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiSyncNodeSend(unsigned int destNode, unsigned int size, void *msg)

Sends msg of size size bytes to node destNode. When it returns, you may
reuse the message buffer.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiSyncSendAndFree(unsigned int destPE, unsigned int size, void *msg)

Sends msg of size size bytes to processor destPE. When it returns, the
message buffer has been freed using CmiFree.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiSyncNodeSendAndFree(unsigned int destNode, unsigned int size, void *msg)

Sends msg of size size bytes to node destNode. When it returns, the
message buffer has been freed using CmiFree.

.. code-block:: c++

  CmiCommHandle CmiAsyncSend(unsigned int destPE, unsigned int size, void *msg)

Sends msg of size size bytes to processor destPE. It returns a
communication handle which can be tested using CmiAsyncMsgSent: when
this returns true, you may reuse the message buffer. If the returned
communication handle is 0, message buffer can be reused immediately,
thus saving a call to CmiAsyncMsgSent.

.. code-block:: c++

  CmiCommHandle CmiAsyncNodeSend(unsigned int destNode, unsigned int size, void *msg)

Sends msg of size size bytes to node destNode. It returns a
communication handle which can be tested using CmiAsyncMsgSent: when
this returns true, you may reuse the message buffer. If the returned
communication handle is 0, message buffer can be reused immediately,
thus saving a call to CmiAsyncMsgSent.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiSyncVectorSend(int destPE, int len, int sizes[], char *msgComps[])

Concatenates several pieces of data and sends them to
processor destPE. The data consists of len pieces residing in different
areas of memory, which are logically concatenated. The msgComps array
contains pointers to the pieces; the size of msgComps[i] is taken from
sizes[i]. When it returns, sizes, msgComps and the message components
specified in msgComps can be immediately reused.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiSyncVectorSendAndFree(int destPE, int len, int sizes[], char *msgComps[])

Concatenates several pieces of data and sends them to
processor destPE. The data consists of len pieces residing in different
areas of memory, which are logically concatenated. The msgComps array
contains pointers to the pieces; the size of msgComps[i] is taken from
sizes[i]. The message components specified in msgComps are CmiFreed by
this function therefore, they should be dynamically allocated using
CmiAlloc. However, the sizes and msgComps array themselves are not
freed.

.. code-block:: c++

  CmiCommHandle CmiAsyncVectorSend(int destPE, int len, int sizes[], char *msgComps[])

Concatenates several pieces of data and sends them to
processor destPE. The data consists of len pieces residing in different
areas of memory, which are logically concatenated. The msgComps array
contains pointers to the pieces; the size of msgComps[i] is taken from
sizes[i]. The individual pieces of data as well as the arrays sizes and
msgComps should not be overwritten or freed before the communication is
complete. This function returns a communication handle which can be
tested using CmiAsyncMsgSent: when this returns true, the input
parameters can be reused. If the returned communication handle is 0,
message buffer can be reused immediately, thus saving a call to
CmiAsyncMsgSent.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CmiAsyncMsgSent(CmiCommHandle handle)

Returns true if the communication specified by the given CmiCommHandle
has proceeded to the point where the message buffer can be reused.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiReleaseCommHandle(CmiCommHandle handle)

Releases the communication handle handle and associated resources. It
does not free the message buffer.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiMultipleSend(unsigned int destPE, int len, int sizes[], char *msgComps[])

This function allows the user to send multiple messages that may be
destined for the SAME PE in one go. This is more efficient than sending
each message to the destination node separately. This function assumes
that the handlers that are to receive this message have already been
set. If this is not done, the behavior of the function is undefined.

In the function, The destPE parameter identifies the destination
processor. The len argument identifies the *number* of messages that are
to be sent in one go. The sizes[] array is an array of sizes of each of
these messages. The msgComps[] array is the array of the messages. The
indexing in each array is from 0 to len - 1. (**Note:** Before calling
this function, the program needs to initialize the system to be able to
provide this service. This is done by calling the function
CmiInitMultipleSendRoutine. Unless this function is called, the system
will not be able to provide the service to the user.)

Broadcasting Messages
---------------------
.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiSyncBroadcast(unsigned int size, void *msg)

Sends msg of length size bytes to all processors excluding the processor
on which the caller resides.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiSyncNodeBroadcast(unsigned int size, void *msg)

Sends msg of length size bytes to all nodes excluding the node on which
the caller resides.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiSyncBroadcastAndFree(unsigned int size, void *msg)

Sends msg of length size bytes to all processors excluding the processor
on which the caller resides. Uses CmiFree to deallocate the message
buffer for msg when the broadcast completes. Therefore msg must point to
a buffer allocated with CmiAlloc.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiSyncNodeBroadcastAndFree(unsigned int size, void *msg)

Sends msg of length size bytes to all nodes excluding the node on which
the caller resides. Uses CmiFree to deallocate the message buffer for
msg when the broadcast completes. Therefore msg must point to a buffer
allocated with CmiAlloc.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiSyncBroadcastAll(unsigned int size, void *msg)

Sends msg of length size bytes to all processors including the processor
on which the caller resides. This function does not free the message
buffer for msg.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiSyncNodeBroadcastAll(unsigned int size, void *msg)

Sends msg of length size bytes to all nodes including the node on which
the caller resides. This function does not free the message buffer for
msg.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiSyncBroadcastAllAndFree(unsigned int size, void *msg)

Sends msg of length size bytes to all processors including the processor
on which the caller resides. This function frees the message buffer for
msg before returning, so msg must point to a dynamically allocated
buffer.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiSyncNodeBroadcastAllAndFree(unsigned int size, void *msg)

Sends msg of length size bytes to all nodes including the node on which
the caller resides. This function frees the message buffer for msg
before returning, so msg must point to a dynamically allocated buffer.

.. code-block:: c++

  CmiCommHandle CmiAsyncBroadcast(unsigned int size, void *msg)

Initiates asynchronous broadcast of message msg of length size bytes to
all processors excluding the processor on which the caller resides. It
returns a communication handle which could be used to check the status
of this send using CmiAsyncMsgSent. If the returned communication handle
is 0, message buffer can be reused immediately, thus saving a call to
CmiAsyncMsgSent. msg should not be overwritten or freed before the
communication is complete.

.. code-block:: c++

  CmiCommHandle CmiAsyncNodeBroadcast(unsigned int size, void *msg)

Initiates asynchronous broadcast of message msg of length size bytes to
all nodes excluding the node on which the caller resides. It returns a
communication handle which could be used to check the status of this
send using CmiAsyncMsgSent. If the returned communication handle is 0,
message buffer can be reused immediately, thus saving a call to
CmiAsyncMsgSent. msg should not be overwritten or freed before the
communication is complete.

.. code-block:: c++

  CmiCommHandle CmiAsyncBroadcastAll(unsigned int size, void *msg)

Initiates asynchronous broadcast of message msg of length size bytes to
all processors including the processor on which the caller resides. It
returns a communication handle which could be used to check the status
of this send using CmiAsyncMsgSent. If the returned communication handle
is 0, message buffer can be reused immediately, thus saving a call to
CmiAsyncMsgSent. msg should not be overwritten or freed before the
communication is complete.

.. code-block:: c++

  CmiCommHandle CmiAsyncNodeBroadcastAll(unsigned int size, void *msg)

Initiates asynchronous broadcast of message msg of length size bytes to
all nodes including the node on which the caller resides. It returns a
communication handle which could be used to check the status of this
send using CmiAsyncMsgSent. If the returned communication handle is 0,
message buffer can be reused immediately, thus saving a call to
CmiAsyncMsgSent. msg should not be overwritten or freed before the
communication is complete.

.. _sec:multicast:

Multicasting Messages
---------------------

.. code-block:: c++

  typedef ... CmiGroup;

A CmiGroup represents a set of processors. It is an opaque type. Group
IDs are useful for the multicast functions below.

.. code-block:: c++

  CmiGroup CmiEstablishGroup(int npes, int *pes);

Converts an array of processor numbers into a group ID. Group IDs are
useful for the multicast functions below. Caution: this call uses up
some resources. In particular, establishing a group uses some network
bandwidth (one broadcast’s worth) and a small amount of memory on all
processors.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiSyncMulticast(CmiGroup grp, unsigned int size, void *msg)

Sends msg of length size bytes to all members of the specified group.
Group IDs are created using CmiEstablishGroup.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiSyncMulticastAndFree(CmiGroup grp, unsigned int size, void *msg)

Sends msg of length size bytes to all members of the specified group.
Uses CmiFree to deallocate the message buffer for msg when the broadcast
completes. Therefore msg must point to a buffer allocated with CmiAlloc.
Group IDs are created using CmiEstablishGroup.

.. code-block:: c++

  CmiCommHandle CmiAsyncMulticast(CmiGroup grp, unsigned int size, void *msg)

(Note: Not yet implemented.) Initiates asynchronous broadcast of message
msg of length size bytes to all members of the specified group. It
returns a communication handle which could be used to check the status
of this send using CmiAsyncMsgSent. If the returned communication handle
is 0, message buffer can be reused immediately, thus saving a call to
CmiAsyncMsgSent. msg should not be overwritten or freed before the
communication is complete. Group IDs are created using
CmiEstablishGroup.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiSyncListSend(int npes, int *pes, unsigned int size, void *msg)

Sends msg of length size bytes to npes processors in the array pes.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiSyncListSendAndFree(int npes, int *pes, unsigned int size, void *msg)

Sends msg of length size bytes to npes processors in the array pes. Uses
CmiFree to deallocate the message buffer for msg when the multicast
completes. Therefore, msg must point to a buffer allocated with
CmiAlloc.

.. code-block:: c++

  CmiCommHandle CmiAsyncListSend(int npes, int *pes, unsigned int size, void *msg)

Initiates asynchronous multicast of message msg of length size bytes to
npes processors in the array pes. It returns a communication handle
which could be used to check the status of this send using
CmiAsyncMsgSent. If the returned communication handle is 0, message
buffer can be reused immediately, thus saving a call to CmiAsyncMsgSent.
msg should not be overwritten or freed before the communication is
complete.

.. _reduce:

Reducing Messaging
------------------

Reductions are operations for which a message (or user data structure)
is contributed by each participant processor. All these contributions
are merged according to a merge-function provided by the user. A
Converse handler is then invoked with the resulting message. Reductions
can be on the entire set of processors, or on a subset of the whole.

There are eight functions used to deposit a message into the system,
summarized in Table :numref:`table:reductions`. Half
of them receive as contribution a Converse message (with a Converse
header at its beginning). This message must have already been set for
delivery to the desired handler. The other half (ending with “Struct”)
receives a pointer to a data structure allocated by the user. This
second version may allow the user to write a simpler merging function.
For instance, the data structure could be a tree that can be easily
expanded by adding more nodes.

.. _table:reductions:
.. table:: Reductions functions in Converse

   =========== =============== ================== =================== ====================
   \           **global**      **global with ID** **processor set**   **CmiGroup**
   =========== =============== ================== =================== ====================
   **message** CmiReduce       CmiReduceID        CmiListReduce       CmiGroupReduce
   **data**    CmiReduceStruct CmiReduceStructID  CmiListReduceStruct CmiGroupReduceStruct
   =========== =============== ================== =================== ====================

The signatures for the functions in
Table :numref:`table:reductions` are:

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiReduce(void *msg, int size, CmiReduceMergeFn mergeFn);

  void CmiReduceStruct(void *data, CmiReducePupFn pupFn,
  CmiReduceMergeFn mergeFn, CmiHandler dest, CmiReduceDeleteFn deleteFn);

  void CmiReduceID(void *msg, int size, CmiReduceMergeFn mergeFn,
  CmiReductionID id);

  void CmiReduceStructID(void *data, CmiReducePupFn pupFn, CmiReduceMergeFn mergeFn,
  CmiHandler dest, CmiReduceDeleteFn deleteFn, CmiReductionID id);

  void CmiListReduce(int npes, int *pes, void *msg, int size,
  CmiReduceMergeFn mergeFn, CmiReductionID id);

  void CmiListReduceStruct(int npes, int *pes, void *data, CmiReducePupFn
  pupFn, CmiReduceMergeFn mergeFn, CmiHandler dest, CmiReduceDeleteFn
  deleteFn, CmiReductionID id);

  void CmiGroupReduce(CmiGroup grp, void *msg, int size,
  CmiReduceMergeFn mergeFn, CmiReductionID id);

  void CmiGroupReduceStruct(CmiGroup grp, void *data, CmiReducePupFn pupFn,
  CmiReduceMergeFn mergeFn, CmiHandler dest, CmiReduceDeleteFn deleteFn,
  CmiReductionID id);

Additionally, there are variations of the global reduction functions
that operate on a per-node basis, instead of per-PE.

.. _table:nodereductions:
.. table:: Node reductions functions in Converse

   =========== =================== ======================
   \           **global**          **global with ID**
   =========== =================== ======================
   **message** CmiNodeReduce       CmiNodeReduceID
   **data**    CmiNodeReduceStruct CmiNodeReduceStructID
   =========== =================== ======================

The signatures for the functions in
Table :numref:`table:nodereductions` are:

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiNodeReduce(void *msg, int size, CmiReduceMergeFn mergeFn);

  void CmiNodeReduceStruct(void *data, CmiReducePupFn pupFn,
  CmiReduceMergeFn mergeFn, CmiHandler dest, CmiReduceDeleteFn deleteFn);

  void CmiNodeReduceID(void *msg, int size, CmiReduceMergeFn mergeFn,
  CmiReductionID id);

  void CmiNodeReduceStructID(void *data, CmiReducePupFn pupFn, CmiReduceMergeFn mergeFn,
  CmiHandler dest, CmiReduceDeleteFn deleteFn, CmiReductionID id);

In all the above, msg is the Converse message deposited by the local
processor, size is the size of the message msg, and data is a pointer to
the user-allocated data structure deposited by the local processor. dest
is the CmiHandler where the final message shall be delivered. It is
explicitly passed in “Struct” functions only, since for the message
versions it is taken from the header of msg. Moreover there are several
other function pointers passed in by the user:

.. code-block:: c++

  void * (*mergeFn)(int *size, void *local, void **remote, int count)

Prototype for a CmiReduceMergeFn function pointer argument. This
function is used in all the CmiReduce forms to merge the local
message/data structure deposited on a processor with all the messages
incoming from the children processors of the reduction spanning tree.
The input parameters are in the order: the size of the local data for
message reductions (always zero for struct reductions); the local data
itself (the exact same pointer passed in as first parameter of CmiReduce
and similar); a pointer to an array of incoming messages; the number of
elements in the second parameter. The function returns a pointer to a
freshly allocated message (or data structure for the Struct forms)
corresponding to the merge of all the messages. When performing message
reductions, this function is also responsible to updating the integer
pointed by size to the new size of the returned message. All the
messages in the remote array are deleted by the system; the data pointed
by the first parameter should be deleted by this function. If the data
can be merged “in-place” by modifying or augmenting local, the function
can return the same pointer to local which can be considered freshly
allocated. Each element in remote is the complete incoming message
(including the converse header) for message reductions, and the data as
it has been packed by the pup function (without any additional header)
for struct reductions.

.. code-block:: c++

  void (*pupFn)(pup_er p, void *data)

Prototype for a CmiReducePupFn function pointer argument.
This function will use the PUP framework to
pup the data passed in into a message for sending across the network.
The data can be either the same data passed in as first parameter of any
“Struct” function, or the return of the merge function. It will be
called for sizing and packing. (Note: It will not be called for
unpacking.)

.. code-block:: c++

  void (*deleteFn)(void *ptr)

Prototype for a CmiReduceDeleteFn function pointer argument.
This function is used to delete either the data
structure passed in as first parameter of any “Struct” function, or the
return of the merge function. It can be as simple as “free” or as
complicated as needed to delete complex structures. If this function is
NULL, the data structure will not be deleted, and the program can
continue to use it. Note: even if this function is NULL, the input data
structure may still be modified by the merge function.

CmiReduce and CmiReduceStruct are the simplest reduction function, and
they reduce the deposited message/data across all the processors in the
system. Each processor must to call this function exactly once. Multiple
reductions can be invoked without waiting for previous ones to finish,
but the user is responsible to call CmiReduce/CmiReduceStruct in the
same order on every processor. (**Note:** CmiReduce and CmiReduceStruct
are not interchangeable. Either every processor calls CmiReduce or every
processor calls CmiReduceStruct).

In situations where it is not possible to guarantee the order of
reductions, the user may use CmiReduceID or CmiReduceStructID. These
functions have an additional parameter of type CmiReductionID which will
uniquely identify the reduction, and match them correctly. (**Note:** No
two reductions can be active at the same time with the same
CmiReductionID. It is up to the user to guarantee this.)

CmiNodeReduce, CmiNodeReduceStruct, CmiNodeReduceID, and
CmiNodeReduceStructID are the same, but for nodes instead of PEs.

A CmiReductionID can be obtained by the user in three ways, using one of
the following functions:

.. code-block:: c++

  CmiReductionID CmiGetGlobalReduction()

This function must be called on
every processor, and in the same order if called multiple times. This
would generally be inside initialization code, that can set aside some
CmiReductionIDs for later use.

.. code-block:: c++

  CmiReductionID CmiGetDynamicReduction()

This function may be called only
on processor zero. It returns a unique ID, and it is up to the user to
distribute this ID to any processor that needs it.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiGetDynamicReductionRemote(int handlerIdx, int pe, int dataSize, void *data)

This function may be called on any processor. The produced
CmiReductionID is returned on the specified pe by sending a message to
the specified handlerIdx. If pe is -1, then all processors will receive
the notification message. data can be any data structure that the user
wants to receive on the specified handler (for example to differentiate
between requests). dataSize is the size in bytes of data. If dataSize is
zero, data is ignored. The message received by handlerIdx consists of
the standard Converse header, followed by the requested CmiReductionID
(represented as a 4 bytes integer the user can cast to a CmiReductionID,
a 4 byte integer containing dataSize, and the data itself.

.. code-block:: c++

  CmiReductionID CmiGetGlobalNodeReduction()
  CmiReductionID CmiGetDynamicNodeReduction()
  void CmiGetDynamicNodeReductionRemote(int handlerIdx, int node, int dataSize, void *data)

Same as above, but for nodes instead of PEs.

The other four functions (CmiListReduce, CmiListReduceStruct,
CmiGroupReduce, CmiGroupReduceStruct) are used for reductions over
subsets of processors. They all require a CmiReductionID that the user
must obtain in one of the ways described above. The user is also
responsible that no two reductions use the same CmiReductionID
simultaneously. The first two functions receive the subset description
as processor list (pes) of size npes. The last two receive the subset
description as a previously established CmiGroup
(see :numref:`sec:multicast`).

.. _schedqueue:

Scheduling Messages
-------------------

The scheduler queue is a powerful priority queue. The following
functions can be used to place messages into the scheduler queue. These
messages are treated very much like newly-arrived messages: when they
reach the front of the queue, they trigger handler functions, just like
messages transmitted with CMI functions. Note that unlike the CMI send
functions, these cannot move messages across processors.

Every message inserted into the queue has a priority associated with it.
Converse priorities are arbitrary-precision numbers between 0 and 1.
Priorities closer to 0 get processed first, priorities closer to 1 get
processed last. Arbitrary-precision priorities are very useful in AI
search-tree applications. Suppose we have a heuristic suggesting that
tree node N1 should be searched before tree node N2. We therefore
designate that node N1 and its descendants will use high priorities, and
that node N2 and its descendants will use lower priorities. We have
effectively split the range of possible priorities in two. If several
such heuristics fire in sequence, we can easily split the priority range
in two enough times that no significant bits remain, and the search
begins to fail for lack of meaningful priorities to assign. The solution
is to use arbitrary-precision priorities, aka bitvector priorities.

These arbitrary-precision numbers are represented as bit-strings: for
example, the bit-string “0011000101” represents the binary number
(.0011000101). The format of the bit-string is as follows: the
bit-string is represented as an array of unsigned integers. The most
significant bit of the first integer contains the first bit of the
bitvector. The remaining bits of the first integer contain the next 31
bits of the bitvector. Subsequent integers contain 32 bits each. If the
size of the bitvector is not a multiple of 32, then the last integer
contains 0 bits for padding in the least-significant bits of the
integer.

Some people only want regular integers as priorities. For simplicity’s
sake, we provide an easy way to convert integer priorities to Converse’s
built-in representation.

In addition to priorities, you may choose to enqueue a message “LIFO” or
“FIFO”. Enqueueing a message “FIFO” simply pushes it behind all the
other messages of the same priority. Enqueueing a message “LIFO” pushes
it in front of other messages of the same priority.

Messages sent using the CMI functions take precedence over everything in
the scheduler queue, regardless of priority.

A recent addition to Converse scheduling mechanisms is the introduction
of node-level scheduling designed to support low-overhead programming
for the SMP clusters. These functions have “Node” in their names. All
processors within the node has access to the node-level scheduler’s
queue, and thus a message enqueued in a node-level queue may be handled
by any processor within that node. When deciding about which message to
process next, i.e. from processor’s own queue or from the node-level
queue, a quick priority check is performed internally, thus a processor
views scheduler’s queue as a single prioritized queue that includes
messages directed at that processor and messages from the node-level
queue sorted according to priorities.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CsdEnqueueGeneral(void *Message, int strategy, int priobits, int *prioptr)

This call enqueues a message to the processor’s scheduler’s queue, to be
sorted according to its priority and the queueing ``strategy``. The
meaning of the priobits and prioptr fields depend on the value of
strategy, which are explained below.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CsdNodeEnqueueGeneral(void *Message, int strategy, int priobits, int *prioptr)

This call enqueues a message to the node-level scheduler’s queue, to be
sorted according to its priority and the queueing strategy. The meaning
of the priobits and prioptr fields depend on the value of strategy,
which can be any of the following:

-  CQS_QUEUEING_BFIFO: the priobits and prioptr point to a bit-string
   representing an arbitrary-precision priority. The message is pushed
   behind all other message of this priority.

-  CQS_QUEUEING_BLIFO: the priobits and prioptr point to a bit-string
   representing an arbitrary-precision priority. The message is pushed
   in front all other message of this priority.

-  CQS_QUEUEING_IFIFO: the prioptr is a pointer to a signed integer. The
   integer is converted to a bit-string priority, normalizing so that
   the integer zero is converted to the bit-string “1000...” (the
   “middle” priority). To be more specific, the conversion is performed
   by adding 0x80000000 to the integer, and then treating the resulting
   32-bit quantity as a 32-bit bitvector priority. The message is pushed
   behind all other messages of this priority.

-  CQS_QUEUEING_ILIFO: the prioptr is a pointer to a signed integer. The
   integer is converted to a bit-string priority, normalizing so that
   the integer zero is converted to the bit-string “1000...” (the
   “middle” priority). To be more specific, the conversion is performed
   by adding 0x80000000 to the integer, and then treating the resulting
   32-bit quantity as a 32-bit bitvector priority. The message is pushed
   in front of all other messages of this priority.

-  CQS_QUEUEING_FIFO: the prioptr and priobits are ignored. The message
   is enqueued with the middle priority “1000...”, and is pushed behind
   all other messages with this priority.

-  CQS_QUEUEING_LIFO: the prioptr and priobits are ignored. The message
   is enqueued with the middle priority “1000...”, and is pushed in
   front of all other messages with this priority.

Caution: the priority itself is *not copied* by the scheduler.
Therefore, if you pass a pointer to a priority into the scheduler, you
must not overwrite or free that priority until after the message has
emerged from the scheduler’s queue. It is normal to actually store the
priority *in the message itself*, though it is up to the user to
actually arrange storage for the priority.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CsdNodeEmpty()

This function returns non-zero integer when the scheduler’s node-level
queue is empty, zero otherwise.

.. _polling:

Polling for Messages
--------------------

As we stated earlier, Converse messages trigger handler functions when
they arrive. In fact, for this to work, the processor must occasionally
poll for messages. When the user starts Converse, he can put it into one
of several modes. In the normal mode, the message polling happens
automatically. However *user-calls-scheduler* mode is designed to let
the user poll manually. To do this, the user must use one of two polling
functions: CmiDeliverMsgs, or CsdScheduler. CsdScheduler is more
general, it will notice any Converse event. CmiDeliverMsgs is a
lower-level function that ignores all events except for recently-arrived
messages. (In particular, it ignores messages in the scheduler queue).
You can save a tiny amount of overhead by using the lower-level
function. We recommend the use of CsdScheduler for all applications
except those that are using only the lowest level of Converse, the CMI.
A third polling function, CmiDeliverSpecificMsg, is used when you know
the exact event you want to wait for: it does not allow any other event
to occur.

In each iteration, a scheduler first looks for any message that has
arrived from another processor, and delivers it. If there isn’t any, it
selects a message from the locally enqueued messages, and delivers it.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CsdScheduleForever(void)

Extract and deliver messages until the
scheduler is stopped. Raises the idle handling converse signals. This is
the scheduler to use in most Converse programs.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CsdScheduleCount(int n)

Extract and deliver messages until :math:`n`
messages have been delivered, then return 0. If the scheduler is stopped
early, return :math:`n` minus the number of messages delivered so far.
Raises the idle handling converse signals.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CsdSchedulePoll(void)

Extract and deliver messages until no more
messages are available, then return. This is useful for running
non-networking code when the networking code has nothing to do.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CsdScheduler(int n)

If :math:`n` is zero, call CsdSchedulePoll. If :math:`n` is negative,
call CsdScheduleForever. If :math:`n` is positive, call
CsdScheduleCount(\ :math:`n`).

.. code-block:: c++

  int CmiDeliverMsgs(int MaxMsgs)

Retrieves messages from the network message queue and invokes
corresponding handler functions for arrived messages. This function
returns after either the network message queue becomes empty or after
MaxMsgs messages have been retrieved and their handlers called. It
returns the difference between total messages delivered and MaxMsgs. The
handler is given a pointer to the message as its parameter.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiDeliverSpecificMsg(int HandlerId)

Retrieves messages from the network queue and delivers the first message
with its handler field equal to HandlerId. This functions leaves alone
all other messages. It returns after the invoked handler function
returns.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CsdExitScheduler(void)

This call causes CsdScheduler to stop processing messages when control
has returned back to it. The scheduler then returns to its calling
routine.

The Timer
---------

.. code-block:: c++

  double CmiTimer(void)

Returns current value of the timer in seconds. This is typically the
time spent since the ``ConverseInit`` call. The precision of this timer is
the best available on the particular machine, and usually has at least
microsecond accuracy.

Processor Ids
-------------

.. code-block:: c++

  int CmiNumPe(void)

Returns the total number of processors on which the parallel program is
being run.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CmiMyPe(void)

Returns the logical processor identifier of processor on which the
caller resides. A processor Id is between ``0`` and ``CmiNumPe()-1``.

Also see the calls in Section :numref:`utility`.

.. _globalvars:

Global Variables and Utility functions
--------------------------------------

Different vendors are not consistent about how they treat global and
static variables. Most vendors write C compilers in which global
variables are shared among all the processors in the node. A few vendors
write C compilers where each processor has its own copy of the global
variables. In theory, it would also be possible to design the compiler
so that each thread has its own copy of the global variables.

The lack of consistency across vendors, makes it very hard to write a
portable program. The fact that most vendors make the globals shared is
inconvenient as well, usually, you don’t want your globals to be shared.
For these reasons, we added “pseudoglobals” to Converse. These act much
like C global and static variables, except that you have explicit
control over the degree of sharing.

In this section we use the terms Node, PE, and User-level thread as they
are used in Charm++, to refer to an OS process, a worker/communication
thread, and a user-level thread, respectively. In the SMP mode of
Charm++ all three of these are separate entities, whereas in non-SMP
mode Node and PE have the same scope.

Converse PseudoGlobals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Three classes of pseudoglobal variables are supported: node-shared,
processor-private, and thread-private variables.

Node-shared variables (Csv)
   are specific to a node. They are shared among all the PEs within the
   node.

PE-private variables (Cpv)
   are specific to a PE. They are shared by all the objects and Converse
   user-level threads on a PE.

Thread-private variables (Ctv)
   are specific to a Converse user-level thread. They are truly private.

There are five macros for each class. These macros are for declaration,
static declaration, extern declaration, initialization, and access. The
declaration, static and extern specifications have the same meaning as
in C. In order to support portability, however, the global variables
must be installed properly, by using the initialization macros. For
example, if the underlying machine is a simulator for the machine model
supported by Converse, then the thread-private variables must be turned
into arrays of variables. Initialize and Access macros hide these
details from the user. It is possible to use global variables without
these macros, as supported by the underlying machine, but at the expense
of portability.

Macros for node-shared variables:

.. code-block:: c++

  CsvDeclare(type,variable)

  CsvStaticDeclare(type,variable)

  CsvExtern(type,variable)

  CsvInitialize(type,variable)

  CsvAccess(variable)

Macros for PE-private variables:

.. code-block:: c++

  CpvDeclare(type,variable)

  CpvStaticDeclare(type,variable)

  CpvExtern(type,variable)

  CpvInitialize(type,variable)

  CpvAccess(variable)

Macros for thread-private variables:

.. code-block:: c++

  CtvDeclare(type,variable)

  CtvStaticDeclare(type,variable)

  CtvExtern(type,variable)

  CtvInitialize(type,variable)

  CtvAccess(variable)

A sample code to illustrate the usage of the macros is provided in
the example below. There are a few rules that the user
must pay attention to: The ``type`` and ``variable`` fields of the
macros must be a single word. Therefore, structures or pointer types can
be used by defining new types with the ``typedef``. In the sample code,
for example, a ``struct point`` type is redefined with a ``typedef`` as
``Point`` in order to use it in the macros. Similarly, the access macros
contain only the name of the global variable. Any indexing or member
access must be outside of the macro as shown in the sample code
(function ``func1``). Finally, all the global variables must be
installed before they are used. One way to do this systematically is to
provide a module-init function for each file (in the sample code -
``ModuleInit()``. The module-init functions of each file, then, can be
called at the beginning of execution to complete the installations of
all global variables.

.. code-block:: c++

   File: Module1.c

       typedef struct point
       {
            float x,y;
       } Point;


       CpvDeclare(int, a);
       CpvDeclare(Point, p);

       void ModuleInit()
       {
            CpvInitialize(int, a)
            CpvInitialize(Point, p);

            CpvAccess(a) = 0;
       }

       int func1()
       {
            CpvAccess(p).x = 0;
            CpvAccess(p).y = CpvAccess(p).x + 1;
       }

.. _utility:

Utility Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To further simplify programming with global variables on shared memory
machines, Converse provides the following functions and/or macros.
(**Note:** These functions are defined on machines other than
shared-memory machines also, and have the effect of only one processor
per node and only one thread per processor.)

.. code-block:: c++

  int CmiMyNode()

Returns the node number to which the calling processor belongs.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CmiNumNodes()

Returns number of nodes in the system. Note that this is not the same as
``CmiNumPes()``.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CmiMyRank()

Returns the rank of the calling processor within a shared memory node.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CmiNodeFirst(int node)

Returns the processor number of the lowest ranked processor on node
``node``

.. code-block:: c++

  int CmiNodeSize(int node)

Returns the number of processors that belong to the node ``node``.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CmiNodeOf(int pe)

Returns the node number to which processor ``pe`` belongs. Indeed,
``CmiMyNode()`` is a utility macro that is aliased to
``CmiNodeOf(CmiMyPe())``.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CmiRankOf(int pe)

Returns the rank of processor ``pe`` in the node to which it belongs.

.. _nodelocks:

Node-level Locks and other Synchronization Mechanisms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiNodeBarrier()

Provide barrier synchronization at the node level, i.e. all the
processors belonging to the node participate in this barrier.

.. code-block:: c++

  typedef McDependentType CmiNodeLock

This is the type for all the node-level locks in Converse.

.. code-block:: c++

  CmiNodeLock CmiCreateLock(void)

Creates, initializes and returns a new lock. Initially the lock is
unlocked.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiLock(CmiNodeLock lock)

Locks ``lock``. If the ``lock`` has been locked by other processor,
waits for ``lock`` to be unlocked.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiUnlock(CmiNodeLock lock)

Unlocks ``lock``. Processors waiting for the ``lock`` can then compete
for acquiring ``lock``.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CmiTryLock(CmiNodeLock lock)

Tries to lock ``lock``. If it succeeds in locking, it returns 0. If any
other processor has already acquired the lock, it returns 1.

.. code-block:: c++

  voi CmiDestroyLock(CmiNodeLock lock)

Frees any memory associated with ``lock``. It is an error to perform any
operations with ``lock`` after a call to this function.

Input/Output
------------

.. code-block:: c++

  int CmiPrintf(const char *format, ...)

This function does an atomic ``printf()`` on ``stdout``. On machine with
host, this is implemented on top of the messaging layer using
asynchronous sends.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CmiScanf(const char *format, ...)

This function performs an atomic ``scanf`` from ``stdin``. The
processor, on which the caller resides, blocks for input. On machines
with host, this is implemented on top of the messaging layer using
asynchronous send and blocking receive.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CmiError(const char *format, ...)

This function does an atomic ``printf()`` on ``stderr``. On machines
with host, this is implemented on top of the messaging layer using
asynchronous sends.

Spanning Tree Calls
-------------------

Sometimes, it is convenient to view the processors/nodes of the machine
as a tree. For this purpose, Converse defines a tree over
processors/nodes. We provide functions to obtain the parent and children
of each processor/node. On those machines where the communication
topology is relevant, we arrange the tree to optimize communication
performance. The root of the spanning tree (processor based or
node-based) is always 0, thus the CmiSpanTreeRoot call has been
eliminated.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CmiSpanTreeParent(int procNum)

This function returns the processor number of the parent of procNum in
the spanning tree.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CmiNumSpanTreeChildren(int procNum)

Returns the number of children of procNum in the spanning tree.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiSpanTreeChildren(int procNum, int *children)

This function fills the array children with processor numbers of
children of procNum in the spanning tree.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CmiNodeSpanTreeParent(int nodeNum)

This function returns the node number of the parent of nodeNum in the
spanning tree.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CmiNumNodeSpanTreeChildren(int nodeNum)

Returns the number of children of nodeNum in the spanning tree.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiNodeSpanTreeChildren(int nodeNum, int *children)

This function fills the array children with node numbers of children of
nodeNum in the spanning tree.

Isomalloc
---------

It is occasionally useful to allocate memory at a globally unique
virtual address. This is trivial on a shared memory machine (where every
address is globally unique) but more difficult on a distributed memory
machine. Isomalloc provides a uniform interface for allocating globally
unique virtual addresses.

Isomalloc can thus be thought of as a software distributed shared memory
implementation; except data movement between processors is explicit (by
making a subroutine call), not on demand (by taking a page fault).

Isomalloc is useful when moving highly interlinked data structures from
one processor to another, because internal pointers will still point to
the correct locations, even on a new processor. This is especially
useful when the format of the data structure is complex or unknown, as
with thread stacks.

During Converse startup, a global reduction and broadcast takes place in
order to find the intersection of available virtual address space across
all logical nodes. If this operation causes an unwanted delay at startup
or fails entirely for a system-specific reason, it can be disabled with
the command line option ``+no_isomalloc_sync``.

Effective management of the virtual address space across a distributed
machine is a complex task that requires a certain level of organization.
Therefore, Isomalloc is not well-suited to a fully dynamic API for
allocating and migrating blocks on an individual basis. All allocations
made using Isomalloc are managed as part of contexts corresponding to
some unit of work, such as migratable threads. These contexts are
migrated all at once. The total number of contexts must be determined
before any use of Isomalloc takes place.

This API may evolve as new use cases emerge.

.. code-block:: c++

  CmiIsomallocContext CmiIsomallocContextCreate(int myunit, int numunits)

Construct a context for a given unit of work, out of a total number of
slots available. Successive calls to this function must always pass
the same value for ``numunits``. For example, if you are writing code
using migratable threads, you must know at the beginning of execution
what the maximum possible number of threads simultaneously in existence
will be across the entire job, and each thread must have a globally
unique ID. Multiple distinct sets of slots are currently unsupported.

This function in particular is likely to change in the future if new
code using Isomalloc is developed, especially in the realm of
interoperability between multiple simultaneous uses.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiIsomallocContextDelete(CmiIsomallocContext ctx)

Destroy a given context, releasing all allocations owned by it and all
virtual address space used by it.

.. code-block:: c++

  void * CmiIsomallocContextMalloc(CmiIsomallocContext ctx, size_t size)

Allocate ``size`` bytes at a unique virtual address. Returns a pointer
to the allocated region.

.. code-block:: c++

  void * CmiIsomallocContextMallocAlign(CmiIsomallocContext ctx, size_t align, size_t size)

Same as above, but with the alignment also specified. It must be a power
of two.

.. code-block:: c++

  void * CmiIsomallocContextCalloc(CmiIsomallocContext ctx, size_t nelem, size_t size)

Same as ``CmiIsomallocContextMalloc``, but ``calloc`` instead of
``malloc``.

.. code-block:: c++

  void * CmiIsomallocContextRealloc(CmiIsomallocContext ctx, void * ptr, size_t size)

Same as ``CmiIsomallocContextMalloc``, but ``realloc`` instead of
``malloc``.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiIsomallocContextFree(CmiIsomallocContext ctx, void * ptr)

Release the given block, which must have been previously allocated by
the given Isomalloc context. It may also release the underlying virtual
address range, which the system may subsequently reuse.

After a call to this function, any use of the freed space could corrupt
the heap or cause a segmentation fault. It is illegal to free the same
block more than once.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiIsomallocContextPup(pup_er p, CmiIsomallocContext * ctxptr)

Pack/Unpack the given context. This routine can be used to move contexts
across processors, save them to disk, or checkpoint them.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CmiIsomallocContextGetLength(void * ptr)

Return the length, in bytes, of this isomalloc’d block.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CmiIsomallocInRange(void * ptr)

Return 1 if the given address is in the virtual address space used by
Isomalloc, 0 otherwise.
``CmiIsomallocInRange(malloc(size))`` is guaranteed to be zero;
``CmiIsomallocInRange(CmiIsomallocContextMalloc(ctx, size))`` is guaranteed to be one.

Threads
=======

The calls in this chapter can be used to put together runtime systems
for languages that support threads. This threads package, like most
thread packages, provides basic functionality for creating threads,
destroying threads, yielding, suspending, and awakening a suspended
thread. In addition, it provides facilities whereby you can write your
own thread schedulers.

Basic Thread Calls
------------------

.. code-block:: c++

  typedef struct CthThreadStruct *CthThread;

This is an opaque type defined in ``converse.h``. It represents a
first-class thread object. No information is publicized about the
contents of a CthThreadStruct.

.. code-block:: c++

  typedef void (CthVoidFn)(void *);

This is a type defined in ``converse.h``. It represents a function that
returns nothing.

.. code-block:: c++

  typedef CthThread (CthThFn)(void);

This is a type defined in ``converse.h``. It represents a function that
returns a CthThread.

.. code-block:: c++

  CthThread CthSelf()

Returns the currently-executing thread. Note: even the initial flow of
control that inherently existed when the program began executing
``main`` counts as a thread. You may retrieve that thread object using
``CthSelf`` and use it like any other.

.. code-block:: c++

  CthThread CthCreate(CthVoidFn fn, void *arg, int size)

Creates a new thread object. The thread is not given control yet. To
make the thread execute, you must push it into the scheduler queue,
using CthAwaken below. When (and if) the thread eventually receives
control, it will begin executing the specified function ``fn`` with the
specified argument. The ``size`` parameter specifies the stack size in
bytes, 0 means use the default size. Caution: almost all threads are
created with CthCreate, but not all. In particular, the one initial
thread of control that came into existence when your program was first
``exec``\ ’d was not created with ``CthCreate``, but it can be retrieved
(say, by calling ``CthSelf`` in ``main``), and it can be used like any
other ``CthThread``.

.. code-block:: c++

  CthThread CthCreateMigratable(CthVoidFn fn, void *arg, int size, CmiIsomallocContextctx)

Create a thread that can later be moved to other processors. Otherwise
identical to CthCreate. An Isomalloc context is required for organized
allocation management of the thread's stack, as well as any global
variable privatization and heap interception in use.

This is only a hint to the runtime system; some threads implementations
cannot migrate threads, others always create migratable threads. In
these cases, CthCreateMigratable is equivalent to CthCreate.

.. code-block:: c++

  CthThread CthPup(pup_er p,CthThread t)

Pack/Unpack a thread. This can be used to save a thread to disk, migrate
a thread between processors, or checkpoint the state of a thread.

Only a suspended thread can be Pup’d. Only a thread created with
CthCreateMigratable can be Pup’d.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CthFree(CthThread t)

Frees thread ``t``. You may ONLY free the currently-executing thread
(yes, this sounds strange, it’s historical). Naturally, the free will
actually be postponed until the thread suspends. To terminate itself, a
thread calls ``CthFree(CthSelf())``, then gives up control to another
thread.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CthSuspend()

Causes the current thread to stop executing. The suspended thread will
not start executing again until somebody pushes it into the scheduler
queue again, using CthAwaken below. Control transfers to the next task
in the scheduler queue.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CthAwaken(CthThread t)

Pushes a thread into the scheduler queue. Caution: a thread must only be
in the queue once. Pushing it in twice is a crashable error.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CthAwakenPrio(CthThread t, int strategy, int priobits, int *prio)

Pushes a thread into the scheduler queue with priority specified by
``priobits`` and ``prio`` and queueing strategy ``strategy``. Caution: a
thread must only be in the queue once. Pushing it in twice is a
crashable error. ``prio`` is not copied internally, and is used when the
scheduler dequeues the message, so it should not be reused until then.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CthYield()

This function is part of the scheduler-interface. It simply executes
``{ CthAwaken(CthSelf()); CthSuspend(); }``. This combination gives up
control temporarily, but ensures that control will eventually return.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CthYieldPrio(int strategy, int priobits, int *prio)

This function is part of the scheduler-interface. It simply executes
``{CthAwakenPrio(CthSelf(),strategy,priobits,prio);CthSuspend();}``
This combination gives up control temporarily, but ensures that control
will eventually return.

.. code-block:: c++

  CthThread CthGetNext(CthThread t)

Each thread contains space for the user to store a “next” field (the
functions listed here pay no attention to the contents of this field).
This field is typically used by the implementors of mutexes, condition
variables, and other synchronization abstractions to link threads
together into queues. This function returns the contents of the next
field.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CthSetNext(CthThread t, CthThread next)

Each thread contains space for the user to store a “next” field (the
functions listed here pay no attention to the contents of this field).
This field is typically used by the implementors of mutexes, condition
variables, and other synchronization abstractions to link threads
together into queues. This function sets the contents of the next field.

Thread Scheduling and Blocking Restrictions
-------------------------------------------

Converse threads use a scheduler queue, like any other threads package.
We chose to use the same queue as the one used for Converse messages
(see Section :numref:`schedqueue`). Because of this, thread
context-switching will not work unless there is a thread polling for
messages. A rule of thumb, with Converse, it is best to have a thread
polling for messages at all times. In Converse’s normal mode (see
Section :numref:`initial`), this happens automatically. However, in
user-calls-scheduler mode, you must be aware of it.

There is a second caution associated with this design. There is a thread
polling for messages (even in normal mode, it’s just hidden in normal
mode). The continuation of your computation depends on that thread — you
must not block it. In particular, you must not call blocking operations
in these places:

-  In the code of a Converse handler (see
   Sections :numref:`handler1` and :numref:`handler2`).

-  In the code of the Converse start-function (see
   section :numref:`initial`).

These restrictions are usually easy to avoid. For example, if you wanted
to use a blocking operation inside a Converse handler, you would
restructure the code so that the handler just creates a new thread and
returns. The newly-created thread would then do the work that the
handler originally did.

Thread Scheduling Hooks
-----------------------

Normally, when you CthAwaken a thread, it goes into the primary
ready-queue: namely, the main Converse queue described in
Section :numref:`schedqueue`. However, it is possible to hook a
thread to make it go into a different ready-queue. That queue doesn’t
have to be priority-queue: it could be FIFO, or LIFO, or in fact it
could handle its threads in any complicated order you desire. This is a
powerful way to implement your own scheduling policies for threads.

To achieve this, you must first implement a new kind of ready-queue. You
must implement a function that inserts threads into this queue. The
function must have this prototype:

.. code-block:: c++

  void awakenfn(CthThread t, int strategy, int priobits, int *prio);

When a thread suspends, it must choose a new thread to transfer control
to. You must implement a function that makes the decision: which thread
should the current thread transfer to. This function must have this
prototype:

.. code-block:: c++

  CthThread choosefn();

Typically, the choosefn would choose a thread from your ready-queue.
Alternately, it might choose to always transfer control to a central
scheduling thread.

You then configure individual threads to actually use this new
ready-queue. This is done using CthSetStrategy:

.. code-block:: c++

  void CthSetStrategy(CthThread t, CthAwkFn awakenfn, CthThFn choosefn)

Causes the thread to use the specified ``awakefn`` whenever you
CthAwaken it, and the specified ``choosefn`` whenever you CthSuspend it.

CthSetStrategy alters the behavior of CthSuspend and CthAwaken.
Normally, when a thread is awakened with CthAwaken, it gets inserted
into the main ready-queue. Setting the thread’s ``awakenfn`` will cause
the thread to be inserted into your ready-queue instead. Similarly, when
a thread suspends using CthSuspend, it normally transfers control to
some thread in the main ready-queue. Setting the thread’s ``choosefn``
will cause it to transfer control to a thread chosen by your
``choosefn`` instead.

You may reset a thread to its normal behavior using
CthSetStrategyDefault:

.. code-block:: c++

  void CthSetStrategyDefault(CthThread t)

Restores the value of ``awakefn`` and ``choosefn`` to their default
values. This implies that the next time you CthAwaken the specified
thread, it will be inserted into the normal ready-queue.

Keep in mind that this only resolves the issue of how threads get into
your ready-queue, and how those threads suspend. To actually make
everything “work out” requires additional planning: you have to make
sure that control gets transferred to everywhere it needs to go.

Scheduling threads may need to use this function as well:

.. code-block:: c++

  void CthResume(CthThread t)

Immediately transfers control to thread ``t``. This routine is primarily
intended for people who are implementing schedulers, not for end-users.
End-users should probably call ``CthSuspend`` or ``CthAwaken`` (see
below). Likewise, programmers implementing locks, barriers, and other
synchronization devices should also probably rely on ``CthSuspend`` and
``CthAwaken``.

A final caution about the ``choosefn``: it may only return a thread that
wants the CPU, eg, a thread that has been awakened using the
``awakefn``. If no such thread exists, if the ``choosefn`` cannot return
an awakened thread, then it must not return at all: instead, it must
wait until, by means of some pending IO event, a thread becomes awakened
(pending events could be asynchronous disk reads, networked message
receptions, signal handlers, etc). For this reason, many schedulers
perform the task of polling the IO devices as a side effect. If handling
the IO event causes a thread to be awakened, then the choosefn may
return that thread. If no pending events exist, then all threads will
remain permanently blocked, the program is therefore done, and the
``choosefn`` should call ``exit``.

There is one minor exception to the rule stated above (“the scheduler
may not resume a thread unless it has been declared that the thread
wants the CPU using the ``awakefn``”). If a thread ``t`` is part of the
scheduling module, it is permitted for the scheduling module to resume
``t`` whenever it so desires: presumably, the scheduling module knows
when its threads want the CPU.

Timers, Periodic Checks, and Conditions
=======================================

This module provides functions that allow users to insert hooks, i.e.
user-supplied functions, that are called by the system at as specific
conditions arise. These conditions differ from UNIX signals in that they
are raised synchronously, via a regular function call; and that a single
condition can call several different functions.

The system-defined conditions are:

CcdPROCESSOR_BEGIN_IDLE
   Raised when the scheduler first finds it has no messages to execute.
   That is, this condition is raised at the trailing edge of the
   processor utilization graph.

CcdPROCESSOR_STILL_IDLE
   Raised when the scheduler subsequently finds it still has no messages
   to execute. That is, this condition is raised while the processor
   utilization graph is flat.

CcdPROCESSOR_LONG_IDLE
   This is an extension of CcdPROCESSOR_STILL_IDLE for a relatively longer
   period of time. It is raised when the scheduler finds that it doesn't
   have any messages to execute for a long period of time. The default
   LONG_IDLE time is 10 seconds. However, it is customizable using a user
   passed runtime flag ``+longIdleThresh <long idle time in seconds>``.
   This feature is useful for debugging hangs in applications. It can allow
   the user to add a user defined function as a hook to execute when the program
   goes into a long idle state, typically seen during hangs. The test program
   ``tests/charm++/longIdle`` illustrates the usage of CcdPROCESSOR_LONG_IDLE.
   Since the usage of CcdPROCESSOR_LONG_IDLE uses additional timers in the
   scheduler loop, it is only enabled with error checking builds and requires
   the user to build the target with ``--enable-error-checking``.

CcdPROCESSOR_BEGIN_BUSY
   Raised when a message first arrives on an idle processor. That is,
   raised on the rising edge of the processor utilization graph.

CcdPERIODIC
   The scheduler attempts to raise this condition every few
   milliseconds. The scheduling for this and the other periodic
   conditions is nonpreemptive, and hence may be delayed until the
   current entry point is finished.

CcdPERIODIC_10ms
   Raised every 10ms (at 100Hz).

CcdPERIODIC_100ms
   Raised every 100ms (at 10Hz).

CcdPERIODIC_1second
   Raised once per second.

CcdPERIODIC_10second
   Raised once every 10 seconds.

CcdPERIODIC_1minute
   Raised once per minute.

CcdPERIODIC_10minute
   Raised once every 10 minutes.

CcdPERIODIC_1hour
   Raised once every hour.

CcdPERIODIC_12hour
   Raised once every twelve hours.

CcdPERIODIC_1day
   Raised once every day.

CcdSCHEDLOOP
   Raised at every scheduler loop. Use with caution to avoid adding
   significant overhead to the scheduler.

CcdQUIESCENCE
   Raised when the quiescence detection system has determined that the
   system is quiescent.

CcdSIGUSR1
   Raised when the system receives the UNIX signal SIGUSR1. Be aware
   that this condition is thus raised asynchronously, from within a
   signal handler, and all the usual signal handler restrictions apply.

CcdSIGUSR2
   Raised when the system receives the UNIX signal SIGUSR2.

CcdUSER
   The system never raises this or any larger conditions. They can be
   used by the user for application-specific use.

CcdUSERMAX
   All conditions from CcdUSER to CcdUSERMAX (inclusive) are available.

.. code-block:: c++

   int CcdCallOnCondition(int condnum, CcdCondFn fnp, void* arg)

This call instructs the system to call the function indicated by the
function pointer ``fnp``, with the specified argument ``arg``, when
the condition indicated by ``condnum`` is raised next. Multiple
functions may be registered for the same condition number.
``CcdCondFn`` is a function pointer with the signature ``void fnp(void
*userParam)``

.. code-block:: c++

  int CcdCallOnConditionKeep(int condnum, CcdCondFn fnp, void* arg)

As above, but the association is permanent- the given function will
be called again whenever this condition is raised.
Returns an index that may be used to cancel the association later.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CcdCancelCallOnCondition(int condnum, int idx)

  void CcdCancelCallOnConditionKeep(int condnum, int idx)

Delete the given index from the list of callbacks for the given condition. The
corresponding function will no longer be called when the condition is
raised. Note that it is illegal to call these two functions to cancel
callbacks from within ccd callbacks.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CcdRaiseCondition(int condNum)

When this function is called, it invokes all the functions whose
pointers were registered for the ``condNum`` via a *prior* call to
``CcdCallOnCondition`` or ``CcdCallOnConditionKeep``.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CcdCallFnAfter(CcdVoidFn fnp, void* arg, double msLater)

This call registers a function via a pointer to it, ``fnp``, that will
be called at least ``msLater`` milliseconds later. The registered
function ``fnp`` is actually called the first time the scheduler gets
control after ``deltaT`` milliseconds have elapsed. The default
polling resolution for timed callbacks is 5 ms.
``CcdVoidFn`` is a function pointer with the signature ``void fnp(void
*userParam, double currWallTime)``. Note the extra wall-time parameter,
which differs from ``CcdCondFn``, because the runtime system internally
calls a timer in order to invoke periodic callbacks. It passes that
time into the user callback as well to avoid the need for extra timer calls.

.. code-block:: c++

  double CcdSetResolution(double newResolution)

This call sets the polling resolution for completion of timed
callbacks. ``newResolution`` is the updated time in seconds. The
default polling resolution for timed callbacks is 5 ms. The resolution
cannot be any longer than this but it can be set arbitrarily short.
Shorter resolution times can result in a performance decrease due to
more time being spent polling for callbacks but may be preferred in
cases where these need to be triggered quickly and/or are on the
critical path of an application. This function also returns the old
resolution in seconds in case it needs to be reset to a non-default
value.

.. code-block:: c++

  double CcdResetResolution()

This call returns the time based callback polling resolution to its
default, 5 milliseconds. It returns the previously set resolution in
seconds.

.. code-block:: c++

  double CcdIncreaseResolution(double newResolution)

This is a “safe” version of ``CcdSetResolution`` that only ever sets
the resolution to a shorter time. The same caveats about short polling
times affecting performance still apply, This function returns the
previous (and potentially current, if it was shorter than
``newResolution``,) resolution in seconds.

.. _converse_client_server:

Converse Client-Server Interface
================================

This note describes the Converse client-server (CCS) module. This module
enables Converse programs to act as parallel servers, responding to
requests from (non-Converse) programs across the internet.

The CCS module is split into two parts- client and server. The server
side is the interface used by a Converse program; the client side is
used by arbitrary (non-Converse) programs. The following sections
describe both these parts.

A CCS client accesses a running Converse program by talking to a
``server-host``, which receives the CCS requests and relays them to the
appropriate processor. The ``server-host`` is charmrun for netlrts-
versions, and is the first processor for all other versions.

CCS: Starting a Server
----------------------

A Converse program is started using

.. code-block:: bash

   $ charmrun pgmname +pN charmrun-opts pgm-opts

charmrun also accepts the CCS options:

``++server``: open a CCS server on any TCP port number

``++server-port``\ =\ :math:`port`: open the given TCP port as a CCS
server

``++server-auth``\ =\ :math:`authfile`: accept authenticated queries

As the parallel job starts, it will print a line giving the IP address
and TCP port number of the new CCS server. The format is: “ccs: Server
IP = :math:`ip`, Server port = :math:`port` $”, where :math:`ip` is a
dotted decimal version of the server IP address, and :math:`port` is the
decimal port number.

CCS: Client-Side
----------------

A CCS client connects to a CCS server, asks a server PE to execute a
pre-registered handler, and receives the response data. The CCS client
may be written in any language (see CCS network protocol, below), but a
C interface (files “ccs-client.c” and “ccs-client.h”) and Java interface
(file “CcsServer.java”) are available in the charm include directory.

The C routines use the skt_abort error-reporting strategy; see
“sockRoutines.h” for details. The C client API is:

.. code-block:: c++

  void CcsConnect(CcsServer *svr, char *host, int port); Connect to the

given CCS server. svr points to a pre-allocated CcsServer structure.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CcsConnectIp(CcsServer *svr, int ip, int port);

As above, but a numeric IP is specified.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CcsNumNodes(CcsServer *svr);

  int CcsNumPes(CcsServer *svr);

  int CcsNodeFirst(CcsServer *svr, int node);

  int CcsNodeSize(CcsServer *svr,int node);

These functions return information about the parallel
machine; they are equivalent to the Converse calls CmiNumNodes,
CmiNumPes, CmiNodeFirst, and CmiNodeSize.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CcsSendRequest(CcsServer *svr, char *hdlrID, int pe, unsigned int
  size, const char *msg);

Ask the server to execute the handler hdlrID on
the given processor. The handler is passed the given data as a message.
The data may be in any desired format (including binary).

.. code-block:: c++

  int CcsSendBroadcastRequest(CcsServer *svr, const char *hdlrID, int
  size, const void *msg);

As CcsSendRequest, only that the handler hdlrID
is invoked on all processors.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CcsSendMulticastRequest(CcsServer *svr, const char *hdlrID,
  int  npes, int *pes, int size, const void *msg);

As CcsSendRequest, only that the handler hdlrID is invoked on the processors
specified in the array pes (of size npes).

.. code-block:: c++

  int CcsRecvResponse(CcsServer *svr, unsigned int maxsize,
  char *recvBuffer, int timeout);

Receive a response to the previous request
in-place. Timeout gives the number of seconds to wait before returning
0; otherwise the number of bytes received is returned.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CcsRecvResponseMsg(CcsServer *svr, unsigned int *retSize,
  char **newBuf, int timeout);

As above, but receive a variable-length
response. The returned buffer must be free()’d after use.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CcsProbe(CcsServer *svr);

Return 1 if a response is available; otherwise 0.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CcsFinalize(CcsServer *svr);

Closes connection and releases server.

The Java routines throw an IOException on network errors. Use javadoc on
CcsServer.java for the interface, which mirrors the C version above.

CCS: Server-Side
----------------

Once a request arrives on a CCS server socket, the CCS server runtime
looks up the appropriate handler and calls it. If no handler is found,
the runtime prints a diagnostic and ignores the message.

CCS calls its handlers in the usual Converse fashion- the request data
is passed as a newly-allocated message, and the actual user data begins
CmiMsgHeaderSizeBytes into the message. The handler is responsible for
CmiFree’ing the passed-in message.

The interface for the server side of CCS is included in “converse.h”; if
CCS is disabled (in conv-mach.h), all CCS routines become macros
returning 0.

The handler registration interface is:

.. code-block:: c++

  void CcsUseHandler(char *id, int hdlr);

  int CcsRegisterHandler(char *id, CmiHandler fn);

Associate this handler ID string with this function.
hdlr is a Converse handler index; fn is a function pointer.
The ID string cannot be more than 32 characters, including the
terminating NULL.

After a handler has been registered to CCS, the user can also setup a
merging function. This function will be passed in to CmiReduce to
combine replies to multicast and broadcast requests.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CcsSetMergeFn(const char *name, CmiReduceMergeFn newMerge);

Associate the given merge function to the CCS identified by id. This
will be used for CCS request received as broadcast or multicast.

These calls can be used from within a CCS handler:

.. code-block:: c++

  int CcsEnabled(void);

Return 1 if CCS routines are available (from
conv-mach.h). This routine does not determine if a CCS server port is
actually open.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CcsIsRemoteRequest(void);

Return 1 if this handler was called via
CCS; 0 if it was called as the result of a normal Converse message.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CcsCallerId(skt_ip_t *pip, unsigned int *pport);

Return the IP address and TCP port number of the CCS client that invoked this method.
Can only be called from a CCS handler invoked remotely.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CcsSendReply(int size, const void *reply);

Send the given data back to the client as a reply. Can only be called from a CCS handler
invoked remotely. In case of broadcast or multicast CCS requests, the
handlers in all processors involved must call this function.

.. code-block:: c++

  CcsDelayedReply CcsDelayReply(void);

Allows a CCS reply to be delayed until after the handler has completed.
Returns a token used below.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CcsSendDelayedReply(CcsDelayedReply d,int size, const void *reply);

Send a CCS reply for the given request. Unlike CcsSendReply,
can be invoked from any handler on any processor.

CCS: system handlers
--------------------

The CCS runtime system provides several built-in CCS handlers, which are
available in any Converse job:

``ccs_getinfo`` Takes an empty message, responds with information about the
parallel job. The response is in the form of network byte order
(big-endian) 4-byte integers: first the number of parallel nodes, then
the number of processors on each node. This handler is invoked by the
client routine CcsConnect.

``ccs_killport`` Allows a client to be notified when a parallel run exits
(for any reason). Takes one network byte order (big-endian) 4-byte
integer: a TCP port number. The runtime writes “die
n” to this port before exiting. There is no response data.

``perf_monitor`` Takes an empty message, responds (after a delay) with
performance data. When CMK_WEB_MODE is enabled in conv-mach.h, the
runtime system collects performance data. Every 2 seconds, this data is
collected on processor 0 and sent to any clients that have invoked
perf_monitor on processor 0. The data is returned in ASCII format with
the leading string "perf", and for each processor the current load (in
percent) and scheduler message queue length (in messages). Thus a
heavily loaded, two-processor system might reply with the string “perf
98 148230 100 385401”.

CCS: network protocol
---------------------

This information is provided for completeness and clients written in
non-C, non-Java languages. The client and server APIs above are the
preferred way to use CCS.

A CCS request arrives as a new TCP connection to the CCS server port.
The client speaks first, sending a request header and then the request
data. The server then sends the response header and response data, and
closes the connection. Numbers are sent as network byte order
(big-endian) 4-byte integers- network binary integers.

The request header has three fields: the number of bytes of request
data, the (0-based) destination processor number, and the CCS handler
identifier string. The byte count and processor are network binary
integers (4 bytes each), the CCS handler ID is zero-terminated ASCII
text (32 bytes); for a total request header length of 40 bytes. The
remaining request data is passed directly to the CCS handler.

The response header consists of a single network binary integer- the
length in bytes of the response data to follow. The header is thus 4
bytes long. If there is no response data, this field has value 0.

CCS: Authentication
-------------------

By default, CCS provides no authentication- this means any client
anywhere on the internet can interact with the server. :math:`authfile`,
passed to ’++server-auth’, is a configuration file that enables
authentication and describes the authentication to perform.

The configuration file is line-oriented ASCII text, consisting of
security level / key pairs. The security level is an integer from 0 (the
default) to 255. Any security levels not listed in the file are
disallowed.

The key is the 128-bit secret key used to authenticate CCS clients for
that security level. It is either up to 32 hexadecimal digits of key
data or the string "OTP". "OTP" stands for One Time Pad, which will
generate a random key when the server is started. This key is printed
out at job startup with the format "CCS_OTP_KEY:math:`>` Level :math:`i`
key: :math:`hexdigits`" where :math:`i` is the security level in decimal
and :math:`hexdigits` is 32 hexadecimal digits of key data.

For example, a valid CCS authentication file might consist of the single
line "0 OTP", indicating that the default security level 0 requires a
randomly generated key. All other security levels are disallowed.

Converse One Sided Communication Interface
==========================================

This chapter deals with one sided communication support in converse. It
is imperative to provide a one-sided communication interface to take
advantage of the hardware RDMA facilities provided by a lot of NIC
cards. Drivers for these hardware provide or promise to soon provide
capabilities to use this feature.

Converse provides an implementation which wraps the functionality
provided by different hardware and presents them as a uniform interface
to the programmer. For machines which do not have a one-sided hardware
at their disposal, these operations are emulated through converse
messages.

Converse provides the following types of operations to support one-sided
communication.

Registering / Unregistering Memory for RDMA
-------------------------------------------

The interface provides functions to register(pin) and unregister(unpin)
memory on the NIC hardware. The emulated version of these operations do
not do anything.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CmiRegisterMemory(void *addr, unsigned int size);

This function takes an allocated memory at starting address addr of
length size and registers it with the hardware NIC, thus making this
memory DMAable. This is also called pinning memory on the NIC hardware,
making remote DMA operations on this memory possible. This directly
calls the hardware driver function for registering the memory region and
is usually an expensive operation, so should be used sparingly.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CmiUnRegisterMemory(void *addr, unsigned int size);

This function unregisters the memory at starting address addr of length
size, making it no longer DMAable. This operation corresponds to
unpinning memory from the NIC hardware. This is also an expensive
operation and should be sparingly used.

For certain machine layers which support a DMA, we support the function
``void *CmiDMAAlloc(int size);``

This operation allocates a memory region of length size from the DMAable
region on the NIC hardware. The memory region returned is pinned to the
NIC hardware. This is an alternative to CmiRegisterMemory and is
implemented only for hardwares that support this.

RDMA operations (Get / Put)
---------------------------

This section presents functions that provide the actual RDMA operations.
For hardware architectures that support these operations these functions
provide a standard interface to the operations, while for NIC
architectures that do not support RDMA operations, we provide an
emulated implementation. There are three types of NIC architectures
based on how much support they provide for RDMA operations:

-  Hardware support for both *Get* and *Put* operations.

-  Hardware support for one of the two operations, mostly for *Put*. For
   these the other RDMA operation is emulated by using the operation
   that is implemented in hardware and extra messages.

-  No hardware support for any RDMA operation. For these, both the RDMA
   operations are emulated through messages.

There are two different sets of RDMA operations

-  The first set of RDMA operations return an opaque handle to the
   programmer, which can only be used to verify if the operation is
   complete. This suits AMPI better and closely follows the idea of
   separating communication from synchronization. So, the user program
   needs to keep track of synchronization.

-  The second set of RDMA operations do not return anything, instead
   they provide a callback when the operation completes. This suits
   nicely the charm++ framework of sending asynchronous messages. The
   handler(callback) will be automatically invoked when the operation
   completes.

**For machine layer developer:** Internally, every machine layer is free
to create a suitable data structure for this purpose. This is the reason
this has been kept opaque from the programmer.

.. code-block:: c++

  void *CmiPut(unsigned int sourceId, unsigned int targetId, void
  *Saddr, void *Taadr, unsigned int size);

This function is pretty self explanatory. It puts the memory location at
Saddr on the machine specified by sourceId to Taddr on the machine
specified by targetId. The memory region being RDMA’ed is of length size
bytes.

.. code-block:: c++

  void *CmiGet(unsigned int sourceId, unsigned int targetId, void
  *Saddr, void *Taadr, unsigned int size);

Similar to CmiPut except the direction of the data transfer is opposite;
from target to source.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiPutCb(unsigned int sourceId, unsigned int targetId, void
  *Saddr, void *Taddr, unsigned int size, CmiRdmaCallbackFn fn, void
  *param);

Similar to CmiPut except a callback is called when the operation
completes.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiGetCb(unsigned int sourceId, unsigned int targetId, void
  *Saddr, void *Taddr, unsigned int size, CmiRdmaCallbackFn fn, void
  *param);

Similar to CmiGet except a callback is called when the operation
completes.

Completion of RDMA operation
----------------------------

This section presents functions that are used to check for completion of
an RDMA operation. The one sided communication operations are
asynchronous, thus there needs to be a mechanism to verify for
completion. One mechanism is for the programmer to check for completion.
The other mechanism is through callback functions registered during the
RDMA operations.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CmiWaitTest(void *obj);

This function takes this RDMA handle and verifies if the operation
corresponding to this handle has completed.

A typical usage of this function would be in AMPI when there is a call
to AMPIWait. The implementation should call the CmiWaitTest for all
pending RDMA operations in that window.

Random Number Generation
========================

Converse includes support for random number generation using a 64-bit
Linear Congruential Generator (LCG). The user can choose between using a
supplied default stream shared amongst all chares on the processor, or
creating a private stream. Note that there is a limit on the number of
private streams, which at the time of writing was 15,613.

.. code-block:: c++

  struct CrnStream;

This structure contains the current state of a random number stream. The
user is responsible for allocating the memory for this structure.

Default Stream Calls
--------------------

.. code-block:: c++

  void CrnSrand(int seed);

Seeds the default random number generator with ``seed``.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CrnRand(void);

Returns the next random number in the default stream as an integer.

.. code-block:: c++

  int CrnDrand(void);

Returns the next random number in the default stream as a double.

Private Stream Calls
--------------------

.. code-block:: c++

  void CrnInitStream(CrnStream *dest, int seed, int type);

Initializes a new stream with its initial state stored in ``dest``. The
user must supply a seed in ``seed``, as well as the ``type`` of the
stream, where the ``type`` can be 0, 1, or 2.

.. code-block:: c++

  double CrnDouble(CrnStream *genptr);

Returns the next random number in the stream whose state is given by
``genptr``; the number is returned as a double.

.. code-block:: c++

  double CrnInt(CrnStream *genptr);

Returns the next random number in the stream whose state is given by
``genptr``; the number is returned as an integer.

.. code-block:: c++

  double CrnFloat(CrnStream *genptr);

Returns the next random number in the stream whose state is given by
``genptr``; the number is returned as a float. (Note: This function is
exactly equivalent to ``(float) CrnDouble(genptr);``.)

Converse Persistent Communication Interface
===========================================

This chapter deals with persistent communication support in converse. It
is used when point-to-point message communication is called repeatedly
to avoid redundancy in setting up the message each time it is sent. In
the message-driven model like charm, the sender will first notify the
receiver that it will send message to it, the receiver will create
handler to record the message size and malloc the address for the
upcoming message and send that information back to the sender, then if
the machine have one-sided hardware, it can directly put the message
into the address on the receiver.

Converse provides an implementation which wraps the functionality
provided by different hardware and presents them as a uniform interface
to the programmer. For machines which do not have a one-sided hardware
at their disposal, these operations are emulated through converse
messages.

Converse provides the following types of operations to support
persistent communication.

Create / Destroy Persistent Handler
-----------------------------------

The interface provides functions to crate and destroy handler on the
processor for use of persistent communication.

.. code-block:: c++

  Persistenthandle CmiCreatePersistent(int destPE, int maxBytes);

This function creates a persistent communication handler with dest PE
and maximum bytes for this persistent communication. Machine layer will
send message to destPE and setup a persistent communication. A buffer of
size maxBytes is allocated in the destination PE.

.. code-block:: c++

  PersistentReq CmiCreateReceiverPersistent(int maxBytes);
  PersistentHandle CmiRegisterReceivePersistent(PersistentReq req);

Alternatively, a receiver can initiate the setting up of persistent
communication. At receiver side, user calls
CmiCreateReceiverPersistent() which returns a temporary handle type -
PersistentRecvHandle. Send this handle to the sender side and the sender
should call CmiRegisterReceivePersistent() to setup the persistent
communication. The function returns a PersistentHandle which can then be
used for the persistent communication.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiDestroyPersistent(PersistentHandle h);

This function destroys a persistent communication specified by
PersistentHandle h.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiDestroyAllPersistent();

This function will destroy all persistent communication on the local
processor.

Persistent Operation
--------------------

This section presents functions that uses persistent handler for
communications.

.. code-block:: c++

  void CmiUsePersistentHandle(PersistentHandle *p, int n)

This function will ask Charm machine layer to use an array of
PersistentHandle "p"(array size of n) for all the following
communication. Calling with p=NULL will cancel the persistent
communication. n=1 is for sending message to each Chare, n>1 is for
message in multicast-one PersistentHandle for each PE.
