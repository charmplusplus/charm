\section{Sync Entry Methods}
\label{sync}

Generally, entry methods are invoked asynchronously and return {\tt void}. Therefore,
while an entry method may send data back to its invoker, it can only do so by invoking
another asynchronous entry method on the chare object that invoked it.

However, it is possible to use \kw{sync} entry methods, which have blocking
semantics. The data returned by the invocation of such an entry method is
available at the call site when it returns from blocking. This returned data
can either be in the form of a \charmpp message or any type that has the PUP
method implemented. Because the caller of a sync entry
method will block, it must execute in a thread separate from the scheduler;
that is, it must be a \kw{threaded} entry method ({\em cf.} \S~\ref{threaded},
above).  If a \kw{sync} entry method returns a value, it is provided as the
return value from the invocation on the proxy object:

\begin{alltt}
 ReturnMsg* m;
 m = A[i].foo(a, b, c);
\end{alltt}

An example of the use of sync entry methods is given in \testrefdir{sync\_square}.
